Officers received a 911 call at around 1:30 a.m. of a domestic disturbance involving a man armed with knives, according to a news release from the Nampa Police Department. The man was outside, the release said, but went inside when he saw the officers. There were several victims inside the residence.

An officer fired their weapon and shot the suspect, who was transported to a hospital with a non-life-threatening injury, and police got the victims out of the house safely, according to the department.

No officers or victims were hurt during the police response, the release said, though some victims had been injured before Nampa police arrived.

The incident is under investigation by the Critical Incident Task Force. The Idaho State Police is leading the investigation, the release said.

This is the 11th police shooting this year in the Treasure Valley, counting one in Owyhee County, according to a database maintained by the Idaho Statesman, which ties last year's number. There were two other police shootings in Boise this week.

But this year's event, marking 49 years since the signing of that treaty, was overshadowed by the fatal police shooting in Salluit last week.

Hundreds of people gathered across Nunavik on Monday to pay tribute to Joshua Papigatuk, who was killed during that confrontation.

Quebec's police watchdog, Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), is still investigating that shooting, and will not release any more findings before the end of its investigation. It's the 15th police-related death in Nunavik since 2017.

The agreement was Canada's first modern Indigenous land claims treaty. It heralded a new era for Nunavimmiut to get more self-governance, including in policing.

Charlie Watt was one of the negotiators.

""Our vision back then was for the Inuit to take complete control over the police force, in other words running the police and become police themselves,"" he said.

He believes the JBNQA isn't being properly implemented in numerous areas -- not just in policing.

""The government of Quebec is trying to dictate to us what we should be doing and how we should be handling our life,"" he said.

""Inuit need to have to have their own governance in order to be able to make changes and positive changes to their life ... to be able to make laws.""

'Significant changes' to policing in Nunavik from agreement

According to Nunavik Police Service's website, the 1975 signing of the JBNQA brought significant changes in Nunavik.

""An agreement was made between the Sûreté du Québec and the First Nations to implement an Aboriginal police program,"" it said.

Inuit who completed the program became special constables.

That police division then transitioned to the Kativik Regional Police Force in 1995, providing the police service full autonomy. It was rebranded to the Nunavik Police Service in 2021 -- the name the region's police bears today.

Justice advocate Suzy Kauki, who's based in Kuujjuaq, remembers seeing far more Inuit officers on the streets as a young girl.

According to data from the police service, three of 79 officers were Inuit in 2018.

As of September 2024, only two of 125 NPS officers were Inuit.

She believes that's a result of ""how hard it is to be a police officer in your own community and be confronted with all the trauma we have.""

""The decline of Inuit in that model is because of administrative systems failing to follow the ethnic agreement of our modern treaty,"" Kauki said.

Western policing model, rather than Inuit

Mylène Jaccoud is a professor of criminology at Université de Montréal, and was in charge of Indigenous policing issues in the Viens Commission inquiry. That was launched in 2016 by the former provincial Liberal government after allegations of police misconduct against Indigenous women.

Jaccoud said the NPS isn't as autonomous as many had hoped for, even with oversight from the Kativik Regional Government, the regional authority over most of Nunavik.

Firstly, she said police officers come largely from outside of Nunavik, fresh out of the national policing school in Quebec.

""I think this is the one of the biggest problems that we have in the North, people coming up very young and trying to enforce the law,"" she said.

She also appreciates that new recruits can feel isolated in these small communities, which is why she said staff retention and adequate cultural training is vital.

Ultimately, she said the problem can't be solved by simply throwing more money at the issue.

During the Viens Commission inquiry, she tried to recommend a new way of policing -- one that allows Indigenous communities to run their own policing.

""It's not about the ability to deal with the budget and financial resources ... you just end up with the power of dealing with bad resources,"" she said.

""We should implement another model of policing ... in the Aboriginal mentality and cultural mind of Aboriginal people.""

For Charlie Watt, that is the true meaning of self-determination.

""We have a constitutional right to exist,"" he said, pointing to Section 35 of the Constitution which reaffirms the existing Indigenous and treaty rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada.

""That needs to be respected.""

Minnie Grey believes programs like Saqijuq, which means ""a change in wind direction"" in Inuktitut, can play a big role in the discussion about Inuit self-determination. (Submitted by Minnie Grey)

Pairing social workers with police in Puvirnituq

One current model of policing Jaccoud said is the Saqijuq program, which means ""a change in wind direction"" in Inuktitut.

In particular, Jaccoud points to their mobile intervention teams in Puvirnituq, which she believes can help build trust with police.

Saqijuq board member Minnie Grey said there are two teams, pairing one police officer with a social worker. The teams respond to most calls for police assistance, which aren't dangerous criminal incidents in nature.

""It's a really good way of interacting and getting to know people on a personal level, instead of being seen as an outsider that comes in and intervenes in criminal activities,"" she said.

The agreement was Canada's first modern Indigenous land claims treaty. It heralded a new era for Nunavimmiut to get more self-governance, including in policing.

Charlie Watt was one of the negotiators.

""Our vision back then was for the Inuit to take complete control over the police force, in other words running the police and become police themselves,"" he said.

Charlie Watt is a former senator who helped negotiate the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. That was signed in 1975. (Submitted by the Makivik Corporation)

He believes the JBNQA isn't being properly implemented in numerous areas -- not just in policing.

""The government of Quebec is trying to dictate to us what we should be doing and how we should be handling our life,"" he said.

""Inuit need to have to have their own governance in order to be able to make changes and positive changes to their life ... to be able to make laws.""

'Significant changes' to policing in Nunavik from agreement

According to Nunavik Police Service's website, the 1975 signing of the JBNQA brought significant changes in Nunavik.

""An agreement was made between the Sûreté du Québec and the First Nations to implement an Aboriginal police program,"" it said.

Inuit who completed the program became special constables.

That police division then transitioned to the Kativik Regional Police Force in 1995, providing the police service full autonomy. It was rebranded to the Nunavik Police Service in 2021 -- the name the region's police bears today.

Justice advocate Suzy Kauki, who's based in Kuujjuaq, remembers seeing far more Inuit officers on the streets as a young girl.

According to data from the police service, three of 79 officers were Inuit in 2018.

As of September 2024, only two of 125 NPS officers were Inuit.

She believes that's a result of ""how hard it is to be a police officer in your own community and be confronted with all the trauma we have.""

""The decline of Inuit in that model is because of administrative systems failing to follow the ethnic agreement of our modern treaty,"" Kauki said.

Western policing model, rather than Inuit

Mylène Jaccoud is a professor of criminology at Université de Montréal, and was in charge of Indigenous policing issues in the Viens Commission inquiry. That was launched in 2016 by the former provincial Liberal government after allegations of police misconduct against Indigenous women.

Jaccoud said the NPS isn't as autonomous as many had hoped for, even with oversight from the Kativik Regional Government, the regional authority over most of Nunavik.

Firstly, she said police officers come largely from outside of Nunavik, fresh out of the national policing school in Quebec.

""I think this is the one of the biggest problems that we have in the North, people coming up very young and trying to enforce the law,"" she said.

She also appreciates that new recruits can feel isolated in these small communities, which is why she said staff retention and adequate cultural training is vital.

Ultimately, she said the problem can't be solved by simply throwing more money at the issue.

During the Viens Commission inquiry, she tried to recommend a new way of policing -- one that allows Indigenous communities to run their own policing.

""It's not about the ability to deal with the budget and financial resources ... you just end up with the power of dealing with bad resources,"" she said.

""We should implement another model of policing ... in the Aboriginal mentality and cultural mind of Aboriginal people.""

For Charlie Watt, that is the true meaning of self-determination.

""We have a constitutional right to exist,"" he said, pointing to Section 35 of the Constitution which reaffirms the existing Indigenous and treaty rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada.

""That needs to be respected.""

Minnie Grey believes programs like Saqijuq, which means ""a change in wind direction"" in Inuktitut, can play a big role in the discussion about Inuit self-determination. (Submitted by Minnie Grey)

Pairing social workers with police in Puvirnituq

One current model of policing Jaccoud said is the Saqijuq program, which means ""a change in wind direction"" in Inuktitut.

In particular, Jaccoud points to their mobile intervention teams in Puvirnituq, which she believes can help build trust with police.

Saqijuq board member Minnie Grey said there are two teams, pairing one police officer with a social worker. The teams respond to most calls for police assistance, which aren't dangerous criminal incidents in nature.

""It's a really good way of interacting and getting to know people on a personal level, instead of being seen as an outsider that comes in and intervenes in criminal activities,"" she said.

Grey believes Saqijuq can fit into the wider discussion of self-determination for Inuit.

""It pushes us to take things into our own hands and do things the way we see fit ... without having to depend on outside influences.""",,2024-11-14,

Police identified the pair Thursday afternoon as 31-year-old Rachael Martinez and 39-year-old Jose Medina.

Thursday night, their loved ones gathered at the scene of their murders for a small vigil, leaving flowers and candles to mark the spot where the two lost their lives.

The couple leaves behind four children; the oldest is 15, and the youngest is just 3 years old.

ABC 10News spoke with Rachael's sister, Charlene Martinez, at the vigil.

""They can't believe that it's true. Last night I was up until 3 in the morning because the babies were up and crying, like waking up,"" says Martinez about the couple's children.

Martinez says the family never saw this crime coming and wonders if the system failed her sister and husband.

Both reported the suspect, who Rachael once dated, saying he'd been harassing them. He had been arrested and accused of domestic violence, including false imprisonment and sex crimes.

Martinez says her sister was the family hostess and a fantastic cook, and her brother-in-law was the life of the party, who loved to grab the mic and sing at family gatherings.

The family's focus is now on the couple's four children, currently in the care of Rachael's sister.

""Just kissed them last night, gave them a kiss to everyone, and I told them 'I love you and your tía is going to be here,'"" says Martinez about her nieces and nephews.

SAN DIEGO (KGTV) - On Wednesday, a man named Jonathan saw, heard, and recorded the deadly officer-involved shooting involving a suspect and police in Little Italy.

""And he's just like avoiding them, and they're like 'Drop the weapon, drop the weapon,'"" Jonathan said.

He shared the video he recorded with ABC 10News after the incident.

""You actually see the shooter standing behind the gray boxes,"" Jonathan said.

Police said the suspect allegedly killed two people downtown earlier that morning before being cornered at Kettner and Juniper in Little Italy.

""As the trolley's passing, then you'll hear the gunshots fire,"" Jonathan said.

Jonathan told us his own safety was a top concern as shots were fired.

""Worrying about the trolley passing as well. That was a concern because we have a lot of friends that ride the trolley as well,"" Jonathan said.

I followed through with MTS about Jonathan's concern.

MTS told ABC 10News that an in-service trolley traveled through the area at the time of the shooting. It was checked out for visible damage, though none was reported.

ABC 10News spoke with Ray Shay, who was a former San Diego Police Department SWAT commanding officer and was a lethal force instructor at the regional police academy, on Thursday.

""We always trained police officers to look at the big picture. Focus on the threat but be aware of what's around you,"" Shay said.

We spoke with him regarding how officers are trained to handle these standoffs and shootouts, in addition to the conditions that we could see in the video.

""Keep in mind, this armed suspect was basically in a cul-de-sac, commercial buildings. That is a good backdrop or field of fire,"" Shay said. ""So, with the trolley going behind, that is not necessarily a no-shoot.""

Shay also said the caliber of the weapons used by police could have played a factor as well.

""The caliber of the weapons firearms that officers on the scene were using were small caliber, meaning they do not have the power to punch through thick metal or to injure the people inside on the trolley,"" Shay said.

That appears evident in the video ABC 10News got on Thursday.

Here's a look at the utility box that the suspect was hiding behind at the time:

There are plenty of bullet holes from the gunfire, but no rounds appear to go through the metal.

Durham had called emergency services at 12:40 a.m. Tuesday and reported people were firing guns and attempting to break into his house, where he and his 15-year-old daughter were.

Officers responded to the scene and found cars with broken windows and kicked in the door to the residence after hearing screams coming from inside the home. After entering the home, Bookman turned a corner and saw Durham with 31-year-old Alejandro Budrauch, as the two were wrestling for control of a knife, according to police.

Bookman told the two to drop the knife before shooting Durham once. After Durham falls to the ground, Bookman fires five more rounds at the man, who was not moving, bodycam footage shows. Durham was pronounced dead at the scene.

Metro officials said they could not confirm whether Bookman knew Durham was the one who had placed the call before entering the home, and that no guns were found on the premises. Budrauch was arrested and booked on four charges, including home invasion with a deadly weapon and child abuse, neglect or endangerment.

Metro Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren said the investigation is still in the early stages and said it ""wasn't appropriate to speculate"" on the details of the case. Koren also asserted officers are often asked to make quick decisions based on their perceptions of threats.

""They don't have the ability to stop time, and stop the video, and get a still and then spend minutes, let alone hours or days or months, analyzing that information to make their decision,"" Koren said Thursday during a press conference. ""They have matter of seconds, if not split seconds, to make very challenging decisions.""

Durham's death marks the 13 shooting by Metro police in 2024 and the eighth fatal shooting. At the same time in 2023 there had been six police shootings, two of which were fatal.",,2024-11-15,

According to SDPD's press release, the victims who were found shot and killed in their car just a block up the road from the courthouse were identified as a married couple: 31-year-old Rachael Martinez and Jose Medina, 39. SDPD says the shooter, 26-year-old Christopher Farrell, had started dating Martinez in Aug. 2024, and she later filed a police report accusing him of domestic violence, false imprisonment and sex crimes on Oct. 4.

After the shooting near the courthouse, Farrell was ultimately confronted by police in Little Italy, where, after a shootout, he was shot and killed. A Harbor Police officer was also shot in that exchange but is now recovering.

SDPD officers obtained an emergency protective order for Martinez following her Oct. 4 report. The initial investigation showed Farrell was a security guard for Inter-Con Security, which works with the Metropolitan Transit System on a contract basis. The press release says the officers responded to an MTS office at 1600 Newton Ave. and arrested Farrell, booking him into San Diego County Jail.

He was fired from his job, and his work weapon was taken from him, SDPD says.

A detective from SDPD's domestic violence unit took up the case, and he re-interviewed Martinez and consulted with a prosecutor specializing

in domestic violence, the department says.

SDPD says at that point, the case had ""insufficient evidence and corroboration to immediately move forward.""

On Oct. 7, Martinez was granted a temporary restraining order against Farrell; however, SDPD says it's unclear if he was ever served with the order.

The restraining order hearing was continued to Nov. 13, the day Martinez and Medina were gunned down.

""It appears likely that Martinez and Medina had arrived near the courthouse for the purpose of attending the restraining order hearing,"" SDPD's press release says.

ABC 10News has obtained the court document that shows Farrell was scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday for that restraining order hearing. According to the documents, Martinez and Medina filed the order against him. In her filing, Martinez says Farrell began harassing she and her husband once he learned she was married.

The court document states that one day in September, Martinez went to confront Farrell at his apartment, and once inside, she says he physically and sexually assaulted her.

The situation unfolded on Friday, November 1 at 6:45 p.m. in the Carondelet neighborhood on Idaho Avenue.

Prior to the arrival of law enforcement, Flemming was reportedly making threats towards his mother and another woman. He was seen attempting to damage a gate to a vinyl fence using a hammer in a gangway. When the police arrived at the scene, Flemming started walking towards the officers while still holding the hammer despite being ordered to drop it.

In response to the perceived threat, a 30-year-old officer with over 6 years of experience fired a shot that struck Flemming in the leg. Another officer, also 30 years old but with 2 years of service, used a taser to subdue the teenager. Flemming was then taken to a hospital where he is currently in stable condition. Fortunately, no officers were harmed during the confrontation.

Due to the recent mental health crises exhibited by the suspect, an affidavit for a mandatory psychological evaluation was filed. The Circuit Attorney's Office has pressed charges against Flemming for unlawful use of a weapon and second-degree property damage.

It is essential to address the underlying mental health issues that contributed to this incident and ensure that individuals like Flemming receive the appropriate support and treatment needed to prevent such situations from reoccurring. Mental health crises can pose significant challenges for both law enforcement officers and the individuals involved, highlighting the importance of effective crisis intervention strategies and mental health resources within communities.

By raising awareness about mental health issues and promoting access to mental health services, we can work towards creating a safer and more supportive environment for everyone.

Kevin Steinfeldt, 58, was the proprietor of the Federal House Inn in Plymouth, where the Nov. 7 incident occurred.

The AG's office said an autopsy determined that Steinfeldt died from a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, and his death was ruled a suicide. The autopsy found Steinfeldt also sustained additional gunshot wounds, according to a news release.

On the afternoon of Nov. 7, Plymouth police responded to a report of a disturbance at 27 Route 25, the location of the Federal House Inn. When the officers arrived, they heard sounds ""consistent with gunshots"" coming from inside the inn, and a man had barricaded himself inside, according to the AG's office.

The State Police crisis negotiation team and SWAT unit responded to the scene, and attempted to communicate with the man inside, who was armed with a rifle, authorities said.

Shortly before 1 a.m., members of the SWAT team reported that they had fired on the armed man, whose body was found near a first-floor doorway with apparent gunshot wounds.

The man, later identified as Steinfeldt, was pronounced dead at the scene. No police officers were hurt and authorities said there was no threat to the public.

Six members of the State Police SWAT unit fired their weapons, according to the AG's office. Their names are being withheld until formal interviews are concluded, the AG's office said.

A memorial site, ""Remembering Kevin Steinfeldt,"" has been set up on social media, where Steinfeldt was identified as a member of the New Canaan Fire Department and EMS.

""We hope people who love Kevin will find comfort in visiting his profile to remember and celebrate his life,"" the site reads.

The Federal House Inn's website describes Steinfeldt as a native New Englander who traveled the world with his daughter, including to Egypt, Indonesia, Nepal, Peru and Sri Lanka. ""Kevin was a stay at home father who greatly enjoyed raising his daughter here in New Hampshire,"" it said.

According to the website, Steinfeldt's interests included ""sustainable living, fitness, and taking care of you!""",,2024-11-14,

(AP) -- Opening statements are expected Friday in the trial of the man accused of killing a Georgia nursing student, in a case that helped fan the immigration debate during the last election cycle.

Jose Ibarra is charged with murder and other crimes in the February killing of Laken Hope Riley, whose body was found on the University of Georgia Campus. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial, meaning his case will be heard and decided by Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard.

Prosecutors are expected to try to prove that Ibarra hit the 22-year-old Augusta University College of Nursing student in the head, asphyxiated her and intended to sexually assault her. They have chosen not to seek the death penalty, but they said in a court filing that they intended to seek a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

The killing added fuel to the national debate over immigration when federal authorities said Ibarra, who is Venezuelan, illegally entered the U.S. in 2022 and was allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case.

Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump, blamed Democratic President Joe Biden's border policies for her death. As he spoke about border security during his State of the Union address just weeks after the killing, Biden mentioned Riley by name.

Riley's body was found on Feb. 22 near running trails after a friend told police she had not returned from a morning run. Police have said her killing appeared to be a random attack. Ibarra was arrested the next day and is being held in the Athens-Clarke County Jail without bond.

Ibarra is charged with one count of malice murder, three counts of felony murder and one count each of kidnapping, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, hindering an emergency telephone call, tampering with evidence and being a peeping Tom.

Prosecutors say that on the day of Riley's killing, Ibarra peered into the window of an apartment in a university housing building, which is the basis for the peeping Tom charge.

Ahead of the trial, defense attorneys unsuccessfully tried to have the proceedings moved out of Athens, a city of about 130,000 people in northeastern Georgia. They also wanted to have the peeping Tom charge handled separately and to exclude some evidence and expert testimony.",,2024-11-15,

(AP) -- Opening statements are expected Friday in the trial of the man accused of killing a Georgia nursing student, in a case that helped fan the immigration debate during the last election cycle.

Jose Ibarra is charged with murder and other crimes in the February killing of Laken Hope Riley, whose body was found on the University of Georgia Campus. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial, meaning his case will be heard and decided by Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard.

Prosecutors are expected to try to prove that Ibarra hit the 22-year-old Augusta University College of Nursing student in the head, asphyxiated her and intended to sexually assault her. They have chosen not to seek the death penalty, but they said in a court filing that they intended to seek a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

The killing added fuel to the national debate over immigration when federal authorities said Ibarra, who is Venezuelan, illegally entered the U.S. in 2022 and was allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case.

Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump, blamed Democratic President Joe Biden's border policies for her death. As he spoke about border security during his State of the Union address just weeks after the killing, Biden mentioned Riley by name.

Riley's body was found on Feb. 22 near running trails after a friend told police she had not returned from a morning run. Police have said her killing appeared to be a random attack. Ibarra was arrested the next day and is being held in the Athens-Clarke County Jail without bond.

Ibarra is charged with one count of malice murder, three counts of felony murder and one count each of kidnapping, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, hindering an emergency telephone call, tampering with evidence and being a peeping Tom.

Prosecutors say that on the day of Riley's killing, Ibarra peered into the window of an apartment in a university housing building, which is the basis for the peeping Tom charge.

(AP) -- Opening statements are expected Friday in the trial of the man accused of killing a Georgia nursing student, in a case that helped fan the immigration debate during the last election cycle.

Jose Ibarra is charged with murder and other crimes in the February killing of Laken Hope Riley, whose body was found on the University of Georgia Campus. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial, meaning his case will be heard and decided by Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard.

Prosecutors are expected to try to prove that Ibarra hit the 22-year-old Augusta University College of Nursing student in the head, asphyxiated her and intended to sexually assault her. They have chosen not to seek the death penalty, but they said in a court filing that they intended to seek a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Jose Ibarra is charged with murder and other crimes in the February killing of Laken Hope Riley, whose body was found on the University of Georgia Campus. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial, meaning his case will be heard and decided by Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard.

Prosecutors are expected to try to prove that Ibarra hit the 22-year-old Augusta University College of Nursing student in the head, asphyxiated her and intended to sexually assault her. They have chosen not to seek the death penalty, but they said in a court filing that they intended to seek a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

The killing added fuel to the national debate over immigration when federal authorities said Ibarra, who is Venezuelan, illegally entered the U.S. in 2022 and was allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case.

Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump, blamed Democratic President Joe Biden's border policies for her death. As he spoke about border security during his State of the Union address just weeks after the killing, Biden mentioned Riley by name.

Riley's body was found on Feb. 22 near running trails after a friend told police she had not returned from a morning run. Police have said her killing appeared to be a random attack. Ibarra was arrested the next day and is being held in the Athens-Clarke County Jail without bond.

Ibarra is charged with one count of malice murder, three counts of felony murder and one count each of kidnapping, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, hindering an emergency telephone call, tampering with evidence and being a peeping Tom.

A substitute teacher who was banned from teaching in Washington County after reportedly using a student to reenact the police killing of George Floyd has lost his job as a police officer in western Wisconsin.

Steven Williams, an officer with the Prescott Police Department, had been on administrative leave since last month when the allegations about his conduct at Woodbury High School came to light last month.

In a separation agreement between Williams, police union and the city set to go into effect Friday, Nov. 15, Williams will resign from the department rather than face termination. He'll get a payout of his vacation time and can keep his health insurance through the end of the month.

Williams' reenactment of Floyd's 2020 murder by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was just one of several ""inappropriate and racially harmful"" actions he took in the classroom on Oct. 14, according to officials with South Washington County Schools.

He reportedly mimicked pointing a gun at a student, told sexist jokes, spoke in detail about bodies he had seen, shared explicit details about two sexual assault cases he had investigated and said ""police brutality isn't real,"" according to the district.

Students had shared audio and video recordings of Williams with school administrators, who then removed Williams from the classroom and escorted him off the premises, Superintendent Julie Nielsen said.

Williams, who had served for two years with the Prescott Police Department, had subbed for teachers in South Washington County seven times since he started the job in March 2024, according to the district.

Williams was hired by Teachers On Call, a third-party vendor that provides the district's substitute teachers.

Williams, who had served for two years with the Prescott Police Department, had subbed for teachers in South Washington County seven times since he started the job in March 2024, according to the district.

Williams was hired by Teachers On Call, a third-party vendor that provides the district's substitute teachers.",,2024-11-15,

That means bringing back gang-related sentencing enhancements, allowing prosecutors to file juvenile charges more freely, and having prosecutors attend parole hearings with victims' families again, where they can help argue against the release of convicts, Hochman said.

The former Republican-turned-independent also plans to return to prosecuting low-level nonviolent crimes that he said the current district attorney has not, such as criminal threats, trespassing, disturbing the peace and loitering, which often involve those experiencing homelessness.

Anyone who breaks the law will receive ""proportional"" consequences -- no more ""get out of jail free"" cards, Hochman said in the interview Wednesday.

At the same time, he wants to look at solutions that don't necessarily involve locking criminals up, such as court-mandated drug treatment, community service, and restitution.

""There's a culture of lawlessness"" that has been ""perpetrated"" by Gascón's office, Hochman said.

""We're going to reverse that,"" he said. ""You basically say, 'Here are the lines in our society, the lines are the laws, I'm going to consistently, fairly and impartially enforce them and here the real consequences on the other side. So if you want to, test me. If you think I'm bluffing, I'm not bluffing.'""

Hochman says he doesn't want to simply fill up prisons again.

""This is my message to people who believe in criminal justice reform: I believe in it as well,"" Hochman said. ""The difference between myself and my predecessor is it won't be a bunch of talk.""

Hochman's victory Nov. 5 to become top prosecutor in the nation's most populous county of 10 million people reflected growing discontent in California with progressive district attorneys who have pushed criminal justice reform.

Gascón, a former San Francisco police chief, was elected in 2020 during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota as part of a wave of progressive prosecutors elected nationwide.

He brought several controversial changes to the district attorney's office that were seen by critics as soft on crime, such as ending cash bail and not allowing prosecutors to charge juveniles as adults or ask for sentencing enhancements. He also recently addressed the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, saying he would seek resentencing for the brothers who received life sentences for the shotgun killings of their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1989. Hochman, who could influence the Menendez case, said he could not comment on the resentencing recommendation until he has time to review confidential documents related to the brothers.

Gascón defended his work, saying in his concession statement: ""I'm deeply proud of what we've accomplished over the past four years and grateful to the communities who have been and will always be the heart of criminal justice reform.""

In 2014, Gascón, then district attorney in San Francisco, co-authored a ballot measure passed by California voters that reclassified certain low-level drug and property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. The measure was approved as California spent years struggling with a 2009 federal court order to reduce the population in the state's overcrowded prisons.

But increased property crime in LA County, emphasized by viral videos of smash-and-grab retail theft, as well as a worsening drug epidemic and increasing homelessness have fed a feeling of lawlessness and frustration that voters brought to the polls last week.

Prosecutors across the state are now armed with the passage this month of Proposition 36, a ballot measure that gives them the ability to charge shoplifting and drug possession crimes as felonies after a third offense.

Hochman declined to say whether his office plans to review current misdemeanor cases to elevate them to felonies but said the ultimate goal is deterrence. His goal is to return to a year like 2014, which he said was considered the region's safest year in the last 50 years.

""I don't predict that you're going to have thousands of people now going to prison,"" he said. ""The goal is ultimately to deter them from committing the crimes in the first place. That's when I'll know that I'm actually doing something that is effective in the criminal justice system, not by filling prisons to the breaking point. That's a failure of the system.""

With a little over two weeks before being sworn into office and taking over a department of more than 700 prosecutors, Hochman spent a recent morning this week in Hermosa Beach, a city south of Los Angeles, observing ""homeless court.""

The program, which began in the coastal city of Redondo Beach, gives people experiencing homelessness the opportunity to avoid prosecution for nonviolent misdemeanor charges or municipal code violations in exchange for accepting judge-mandated services that can eventually lead to placement in housing.

""I thought it was a really innovative way to try and deal with low-level homeless crime ... and get the homeless individuals the help that they need to ensure that they actually won't ever have to be back in court,"" Hochman said.",,2024-11-15,

Hochman declined to say whether his office plans to review current misdemeanor cases to elevate them to felonies but said the ultimate goal is deterrence. His goal is to return to a year like 2014, which he said was considered the region's safest year in the last 50 years.

""I don't predict that you're going to have thousands of people now going to prison,"" he said. ""The goal is ultimately to deter them from committing the crimes in the first place. That's when I'll know that I'm actually doing something that is effective in the criminal justice system, not by filling prisons to the breaking point. That's a failure of the system.""

With a little over two weeks before being sworn into office and taking over a department of more than 700 prosecutors, Hochman spent a recent morning this week in Hermosa Beach, a city south of Los Angeles, observing ""homeless court.""

The program, which began in the coastal city of Redondo Beach, gives people experiencing homelessness the opportunity to avoid prosecution for nonviolent misdemeanor charges or municipal code violations in exchange for accepting judge-mandated services that can eventually lead to placement in housing.

""I thought it was a really innovative way to try and deal with low-level homeless crime ... and get the homeless individuals the help that they need to ensure that they actually won't ever have to be back in court,"" Hochman said.",,2024-11-15,

That means bringing back gang-related sentencing enhancements, allowing prosecutors to file juvenile charges more freely, and having prosecutors attend parole hearings with victims' families again, where they can help argue against the release of convicts, Hochman said.

The former Republican-turned-independent also plans to return to prosecuting low-level nonviolent crimes that he said the current district attorney has not, such as criminal threats, trespassing, disturbing the peace and loitering, which often involve those experiencing homelessness.

Anyone who breaks the law will receive ""proportional"" consequences -- no more ""get out of jail free"" cards, Hochman said in the interview Wednesday.

At the same time, he wants to look at solutions that don't necessarily involve locking criminals up, such as court-mandated drug treatment, community service, and restitution.

""There's a culture of lawlessness"" that has been ""perpetrated"" by Gascón's office, Hochman said.

""We're going to reverse that,"" he said. ""You basically say, 'Here are the lines in our society, the lines are the laws, I'm going to consistently, fairly and impartially enforce them and here the real consequences on the other side. So if you want to, test me. If you think I'm bluffing, I'm not bluffing.'""

Hochman says he doesn't want to simply fill up prisons again.

""This is my message to people who believe in criminal justice reform: I believe in it as well,"" Hochman said. ""The difference between myself and my predecessor is it won't be a bunch of talk.""

Hochman's victory Nov. 5 to become top prosecutor in the nation's most populous county of 10 million people reflected growing discontent in California with progressive district attorneys who have pushed criminal justice reform.

Gascón, a former San Francisco police chief, was elected in 2020 during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota as part of a wave of progressive prosecutors elected nationwide.

He brought several controversial changes to the district attorney's office that were seen by critics as soft on crime, such as ending cash bail and not allowing prosecutors to charge juveniles as adults or ask for sentencing enhancements. He also recently addressed the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, saying he would seek resentencing for the brothers who received life sentences for the shotgun killings of their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1989. Hochman, who could influence the Menendez case, said he could not comment on the resentencing recommendation until he has time to review confidential documents related to the brothers.

Gascón defended his work, saying in his concession statement: ""I'm deeply proud of what we've accomplished over the past four years and grateful to the communities who have been and will always be the heart of criminal justice reform.""

In 2014, Gascón, then district attorney in San Francisco, co-authored a ballot measure passed by California voters that reclassified certain low-level drug and property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. The measure was approved as California spent years struggling with a 2009 federal court order to reduce the population in the state's overcrowded prisons.

Gascón defended his work, saying in his concession statement: ""I'm deeply proud of what we've accomplished over the past four years and grateful to the communities who have been and will always be the heart of criminal justice reform.""

In 2014, Gascón, then district attorney in San Francisco, co-authored a ballot measure passed by California voters that reclassified certain low-level drug and property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. The measure was approved as California spent years struggling with a 2009 federal court order to reduce the population in the state's overcrowded prisons.

But increased property crime in LA County, emphasized by viral videos of smash-and-grab retail theft, as well as a worsening drug epidemic and increasing homelessness have fed a feeling of lawlessness and frustration that voters brought to the polls last week.

Prosecutors across the state are now armed with the passage this month of Proposition 36, a ballot measure that gives them the ability to charge shoplifting and drug possession crimes as felonies after a third offense.

Hochman declined to say whether his office plans to review current misdemeanor cases to elevate them to felonies but said the ultimate goal is deterrence. His goal is to return to a year like 2014, which he said was considered the region's safest year in the last 50 years.

""I don't predict that you're going to have thousands of people now going to prison,"" he said. ""The goal is ultimately to deter them from committing the crimes in the first place. That's when I'll know that I'm actually doing something that is effective in the criminal justice system, not by filling prisons to the breaking point. That's a failure of the system.""

With a little over two weeks before being sworn into office and taking over a department of more than 700 prosecutors, Hochman spent a recent morning this week in Hermosa Beach, a city south of Los Angeles, observing ""homeless court.""

The program, which began in the coastal city of Redondo Beach, gives people experiencing homelessness the opportunity to avoid prosecution for nonviolent misdemeanor charges or municipal code violations in exchange for accepting judge-mandated services that can eventually lead to placement in housing.

""I thought it was a really innovative way to try and deal with low-level homeless crime ... and get the homeless individuals the help that they need to ensure that they actually won't ever have to be back in court,"" Hochman said.",,2024-11-15,

That means bringing back gang-related sentencing enhancements, allowing prosecutors to file juvenile charges more freely, and having prosecutors attend parole hearings with victims' families again, where they can help argue against the release of convicts, Hochman said.

The former Republican-turned-independent also plans to return to prosecuting low-level nonviolent crimes that he said the current district attorney has not, such as criminal threats, trespassing, disturbing the peace and loitering, which often involve those experiencing homelessness.

Anyone who breaks the law will receive ""proportional"" consequences -- no more ""get out of jail free"" cards, Hochman said in the interview Wednesday.

At the same time, he wants to look at solutions that don't necessarily involve locking criminals up, such as court-mandated drug treatment, community service, and restitution.

""There's a culture of lawlessness"" that has been ""perpetrated"" by Gascón's office, Hochman said.

""We're going to reverse that,"" he said. ""You basically say, 'Here are the lines in our society, the lines are the laws, I'm going to consistently, fairly and impartially enforce them and here the real consequences on the other side. So if you want to, test me. If you think I'm bluffing, I'm not bluffing.'""

Hochman says he doesn't want to simply fill up prisons again.

""This is my message to people who believe in criminal justice reform: I believe in it as well,"" Hochman said. ""The difference between myself and my predecessor is it won't be a bunch of talk.""

Hochman's victory Nov. 5 to become top prosecutor in the nation's most populous county of 10 million people reflected growing discontent in California with progressive district attorneys who have pushed criminal justice reform.

Gascón, a former San Francisco police chief, was elected in 2020 during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota as part of a wave of progressive prosecutors elected nationwide.

He brought several controversial changes to the district attorney's office that were seen by critics as soft on crime, such as ending cash bail and not allowing prosecutors to charge juveniles as adults or ask for sentencing enhancements. He also recently addressed the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, saying he would seek resentencing for the brothers who received life sentences for the shotgun killings of their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1989.

Hochman's victory Nov. 5 to become top prosecutor in the nation's most populous county of 10 million people reflected growing discontent in California with progressive district attorneys who have pushed criminal justice reform.

Gascón, a former San Francisco police chief, was elected in 2020 during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota as part of a wave of progressive prosecutors elected nationwide.

He brought several controversial changes to the district attorney's office that were seen by critics as soft on crime, such as ending cash bail and not allowing prosecutors to charge juveniles as adults or ask for sentencing enhancements. He also recently addressed the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, saying he would seek resentencing for the brothers who received life sentences for the shotgun killings of their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1989. Hochman, who could influence the Menendez case, said he could not comment on the resentencing recommendation until he has time to review confidential documents related to the brothers.

Gascón defended his work, saying in his concession statement: ""I'm deeply proud of what we've accomplished over the past four years and grateful to the communities who have been and will always be the heart of criminal justice reform.""

In 2014, Gascón, then district attorney in San Francisco, co-authored a ballot measure passed by California voters that reclassified certain low-level drug and property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. The measure was approved as California spent years struggling with a 2009 federal court order to reduce the population in the state's overcrowded prisons.

But increased property crime in LA County, emphasized by viral videos of smash-and-grab retail theft, as well as a worsening drug epidemic and increasing homelessness have fed a feeling of lawlessness and frustration that voters brought to the polls last week.

Prosecutors across the state are now armed with the passage this month of Proposition 36, a ballot measure that gives them the ability to charge shoplifting and drug possession crimes as felonies after a third offense.

Hochman declined to say whether his office plans to review current misdemeanor cases to elevate them to felonies but said the ultimate goal is deterrence. His goal is to return to a year like 2014, which he said was considered the region's safest year in the last 50 years.

""I don't predict that you're going to have thousands of people now going to prison,"" he said. ""The goal is ultimately to deter them from committing the crimes in the first place. That's when I'll know that I'm actually doing something that is effective in the criminal justice system, not by filling prisons to the breaking point. That's a failure of the system.""

With a little over two weeks before being sworn into office and taking over a department of more than 700 prosecutors, Hochman spent a recent morning this week in Hermosa Beach, a city south of Los Angeles, observing ""homeless court.""

The program, which began in the coastal city of Redondo Beach, gives people experiencing homelessness the opportunity to avoid prosecution for nonviolent misdemeanor charges or municipal code violations in exchange for accepting judge-mandated services that can eventually lead to placement in housing.

""I thought it was a really innovative way to try and deal with low-level homeless crime ... and get the homeless individuals the help that they need to ensure that they actually won't ever have to be back in court,"" Hochman said.",,2024-11-15,

That means bringing back gang-related sentencing enhancements, allowing prosecutors to file juvenile charges more freely, and having prosecutors attend parole hearings with victims' families again, where they can help argue against the release of convicts, Hochman said.

The former Republican-turned-independent also plans to return to prosecuting low-level nonviolent crimes that he said the current district attorney has not, such as criminal threats, trespassing, disturbing the peace and loitering, which often involve those experiencing homelessness.

Anyone who breaks the law will receive ""proportional"" consequences -- no more ""get out of jail free"" cards, Hochman said in the interview Wednesday.

At the same time, he wants to look at solutions that don't necessarily involve locking criminals up, such as court-mandated drug treatment, community service, and restitution.

""There's a culture of lawlessness"" that has been ""perpetrated"" by Gascón's office, Hochman said.

""We're going to reverse that,"" he said. ""You basically say, 'Here are the lines in our society, the lines are the laws, I'm going to consistently, fairly and impartially enforce them and here the real consequences on the other side.

Hochman says he doesn't want to simply fill up prisons again.

""This is my message to people who believe in criminal justice reform: I believe in it as well,"" Hochman said. ""The difference between myself and my predecessor is it won't be a bunch of talk.""

Hochman's victory Nov. 5 to become top prosecutor in the nation's most populous county of 10 million people reflected growing discontent in California with progressive district attorneys who have pushed criminal justice reform.

Gascón, a former San Francisco police chief, was elected in 2020 during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota as part of a wave of progressive prosecutors elected nationwide.

He brought several controversial changes to the district attorney's office that were seen by critics as soft on crime, such as ending cash bail and not allowing prosecutors to charge juveniles as adults or ask for sentencing enhancements. He also recently addressed the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, saying he would seek resentencing for the brothers who received life sentences for the shotgun killings of their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1989. Hochman, who could influence the Menendez case, said he could not comment on the resentencing recommendation until he has time to review confidential documents related to the brothers.

Gascón defended his work, saying in his concession statement: ""I'm deeply proud of what we've accomplished over the past four years and grateful to the communities who have been and will always be the heart of criminal justice reform.""

In 2014, Gascón, then district attorney in San Francisco, co-authored a ballot measure passed by California voters that reclassified certain low-level drug and property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. The measure was approved as California spent years struggling with a 2009 federal court order to reduce the population in the state's overcrowded prisons.

But increased property crime in LA County, emphasized by viral videos of smash-and-grab retail theft, as well as a worsening drug epidemic and increasing homelessness have fed a feeling of lawlessness and frustration that voters brought to the polls last week.

Prosecutors across the state are now armed with the passage this month of Proposition 36, a ballot measure that gives them the ability to charge shoplifting and drug possession crimes as felonies after a third offense.

Hochman declined to say whether his office plans to review current misdemeanor cases to elevate them to felonies but said the ultimate goal is deterrence. His goal is to return to a year like 2014, which he said was considered the region's safest year in the last 50 years.

""I don't predict that you're going to have thousands of people now going to prison,"" he said. ""The goal is ultimately to deter them from committing the crimes in the first place. That's when I'll know that I'm actually doing something that is effective in the criminal justice system, not by filling prisons to the breaking point. That's a failure of the system.""

With a little over two weeks before being sworn into office and taking over a department of more than 700 prosecutors, Hochman spent a recent morning this week in Hermosa Beach, a city south of Los Angeles, observing ""homeless court.""

ASSOCIATED PRESS

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The incoming district attorney for Los Angeles County, Nathan Hochman, said in an interview with The Associated Press that his first task upon taking office is to eliminate the ""pro-criminal blanket policies"" of one of California's most high-profile progressive prosecutors, George Gascón.

That means bringing back gang-related sentencing enhancements, allowing prosecutors to file juvenile charges more freely, and having prosecutors attend parole hearings with victims' families again, where they can help argue against the release of convicts, Hochman said.

The former Republican-turned-independent also plans to return to prosecuting low-level nonviolent crimes that he said the current district attorney has not, such as criminal threats, trespassing, disturbing the peace and loitering, which often involve those experiencing homelessness.

Anyone who breaks the law will receive ""proportional"" consequences -- no more ""get out of jail free"" cards, Hochman said in the interview Wednesday.

At the same time, he wants to look at solutions that don't necessarily involve locking criminals up, such as court-mandated drug treatment, community service, and restitution.

""There's a culture of lawlessness"" that has been ""perpetrated"" by Gascón's office, Hochman said.

""We're going to reverse that,"" he said. ""You basically say, 'Here are the lines in our society, the lines are the laws, I'm going to consistently, fairly and impartially enforce them and here the real consequences on the other side. So if you want to, test me. If you think I'm bluffing, I'm not bluffing.'""

That means bringing back gang-related sentencing enhancements, allowing prosecutors to file juvenile charges more freely, and having prosecutors attend parole hearings with victims' families again, where they can help argue against the release of convicts, Hochman said.

The former Republican-turned-independent also plans to return to prosecuting low-level nonviolent crimes that he said the current district attorney has not, such as criminal threats, trespassing, disturbing the peace and loitering, which often involve those experiencing homelessness.

Anyone who breaks the law will receive ""proportional"" consequences -- no more ""get out of jail free"" cards, Hochman said in the interview Wednesday.

At the same time, he wants to look at solutions that don't necessarily involve locking criminals up, such as court-mandated drug treatment, community service, and restitution.

""There's a culture of lawlessness"" that has been ""perpetrated"" by Gascón's office, Hochman said.

""We're going to reverse that,"" he said. ""You basically say, 'Here are the lines in our society, the lines are the laws, I'm going to consistently, fairly and impartially enforce them and here the real consequences on the other side. So if you want to, test me. If you think I'm bluffing, I'm not bluffing.'""

Hochman says he doesn't want to simply fill up prisons again.

""This is my message to people who believe in criminal justice reform: I believe in it as well,"" Hochman said. ""The difference between myself and my predecessor is it won't be a bunch of talk.""

Hochman's victory Nov. 5 to become top prosecutor in the nation's most populous county of 10 million people reflected growing discontent in California with progressive district attorneys who have pushed criminal justice reform.

Gascón, a former San Francisco police chief, was elected in 2020 during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota as part of a wave of progressive prosecutors elected nationwide.

He brought several controversial changes to the district attorney's office that were seen by critics as soft on crime, such as ending cash bail and not allowing prosecutors to charge juveniles as adults or ask for sentencing enhancements. He also recently addressed the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, saying he would seek resentencing for the brothers who received life sentences for the shotgun killings of their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1989. Hochman, who could influence the Menendez case, said he could not comment on the resentencing recommendation until he has time to review confidential documents related to the brothers.

Gascón defended his work, saying in his concession statement: ""I'm deeply proud of what we've accomplished over the past four years and grateful to the communities who have been and will always be the heart of criminal justice reform.""

In 2014, Gascón, then district attorney in San Francisco, co-authored a ballot measure passed by California voters that reclassified certain low-level drug and property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. The measure was approved as California spent years struggling with a 2009 federal court order to reduce the population in the state's overcrowded prisons.

But increased property crime in LA County, emphasized by viral videos of smash-and-grab retail theft, as well as a worsening drug epidemic and increasing homelessness have fed a feeling of lawlessness and frustration that voters brought to the polls last week.

Prosecutors across the state are now armed with the passage this month of Proposition 36, a ballot measure that gives them the ability to charge shoplifting and drug possession crimes as felonies after a third offense.

Hochman declined to say whether his office plans to review current misdemeanor cases to elevate them to felonies but said the ultimate goal is deterrence. His goal is to return to a year like 2014, which he said was considered the region's safest year in the last 50 years.

""I don't predict that you're going to have thousands of people now going to prison,"" he said. ""The goal is ultimately to deter them from committing the crimes in the first place. That's when I'll know that I'm actually doing something that is effective in the criminal justice system, not by filling prisons to the breaking point. That's a failure of the system.""

With a little over two weeks before being sworn into office and taking over a department of more than 700 prosecutors, Hochman spent a recent morning this week in Hermosa Beach, a city south of Los Angeles, observing ""homeless court.""

The program, which began in the coastal city of Redondo Beach, gives people experiencing homelessness the opportunity to avoid prosecution for nonviolent misdemeanor charges or municipal code violations in exchange for accepting judge-mandated services that can eventually lead to placement in housing.

""I thought it was a really innovative way to try and deal with low-level homeless crime ... and get the homeless individuals the help that they need to ensure that they actually won't ever have to be back in court,"" Hochman said.",,2024-11-15,

Hochman's victory Nov. 5 to become top prosecutor in the nation's most populous county of 10 million people reflected growing discontent in California with progressive district attorneys who have pushed criminal justice reform.

Gascón, a former San Francisco police chief, was elected in 2020 during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota as part of a wave of progressive prosecutors elected nationwide.

He brought several controversial changes to the district attorney's office that were seen by critics as soft on crime, such as ending cash bail and not allowing prosecutors to charge juveniles as adults or ask for sentencing enhancements. He also recently addressed the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, saying he would seek resentencing for the brothers who received life sentences for the shotgun killings of their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1989. Hochman, who could influence the Menendez case, said he could not comment on the resentencing recommendation until he has time to review confidential documents related to the brothers.

Gascón defended his work, saying in his concession statement: ""I'm deeply proud of what we've accomplished over the past four years and grateful to the communities who have been and will always be the heart of criminal justice reform.""

In 2014, Gascón, then district attorney in San Francisco, co-authored a ballot measure passed by California voters that reclassified certain low-level drug and property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. The measure was approved as California spent years struggling with a 2009 federal court order to reduce the population in the state's overcrowded prisons.

But increased property crime in LA County, emphasized by viral videos of smash-and-grab retail theft, as well as a worsening drug epidemic and increasing homelessness have fed a feeling of lawlessness and frustration that voters brought to the polls last week.

Prosecutors across the state are now armed with the passage this month of Proposition 36, a ballot measure that gives them the ability to charge shoplifting and drug possession crimes as felonies after a third offense.

Hochman declined to say whether his office plans to review current misdemeanor cases to elevate them to felonies but said the ultimate goal is deterrence. His goal is to return to a year like 2014, which he said was considered the region's safest year in the last 50 years.

""I don't predict that you're going to have thousands of people now going to prison,"" he said. ""The goal is ultimately to deter them from committing the crimes in the first place.

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The incoming district attorney for Los Angeles County, Nathan Hochman, said in an interview with The Associated Press that his first task upon taking office is to eliminate the ""pro-criminal blanket policies"" of one of California's most high-profile progressive prosecutors, George Gascón.

He also recently addressed the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, saying he would seek resentencing for the brothers who received life sentences for the shotgun killings of their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1989.

Gascón defended his work, saying in his concession statement: ""I'm deeply proud of what we've accomplished over the past four years and grateful to the communities who have been and will always be the heart of criminal justice reform.""

In 2014, Gascón, then district attorney in San Francisco, co-authored a ballot measure passed by California voters that reclassified certain low-level drug and property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. The measure was approved as California spent years struggling with a 2009 federal court order to reduce the population in the state's overcrowded prisons.

But increased property crime in LA County, emphasized by viral videos of smash-and-grab retail theft, as well as a worsening drug epidemic and increasing homelessness have fed a feeling of lawlessness and frustration that voters brought to the polls last week.

Prosecutors across the state are now armed with the passage this month of Proposition 36, a ballot measure that gives them the ability to charge shoplifting and drug possession crimes as felonies after a third offense.

Hochman declined to say whether his office plans to review current misdemeanor cases to elevate them to felonies but said the ultimate goal is deterrence. His goal is to return to a year like 2014, which he said was considered the region's safest year in the last 50 years.

""I don't predict that you're going to have thousands of people now going to prison,"" he said. ""The goal is ultimately to deter them from committing the crimes in the first place. That's when I'll know that I'm actually doing something that is effective in the criminal justice system, not by filling prisons to the breaking point. That's a failure of the system.""

With a little over two weeks before being sworn into office and taking over a department of more than 700 prosecutors, Hochman spent a recent morning this week in Hermosa Beach, a city south of Los Angeles, observing ""homeless court.""

The program, which began in the coastal city of Redondo Beach, gives people experiencing homelessness the opportunity to avoid prosecution for nonviolent misdemeanor charges or municipal code violations in exchange for accepting judge-mandated services that can eventually lead to placement in housing.

""I thought it was a really innovative way to try and deal with low-level homeless crime ... and get the homeless individuals the help that they need to ensure that they actually won't ever have to be back in court,"" Hochman said.",,2024-11-15,

That means bringing back gang-related sentencing enhancements, allowing prosecutors to file juvenile charges more freely, and having prosecutors attend parole hearings with victims' families again, where they can help argue against the release of convicts, Hochman said.

The former Republican-turned-independent also plans to return to prosecuting low-level nonviolent crimes that he said the current district attorney has not, such as criminal threats, trespassing, disturbing the peace and loitering, which often involve those experiencing homelessness.

Anyone who breaks the law will receive ""proportional"" consequences -- no more ""get out of jail free"" cards, Hochman said in the interview Wednesday.

At the same time, he wants to look at solutions that don't necessarily involve locking criminals up, such as court-mandated drug treatment, community service, and restitution.

""There's a culture of lawlessness"" that has been ""perpetrated"" by Gascón's office, Hochman said.

""We're going to reverse that,"" he said. ""You basically say, 'Here are the lines in our society, the lines are the laws, I'm going to consistently, fairly and impartially enforce them and here the real consequences on the other side. So if you want to, test me. If you think I'm bluffing, I'm not bluffing.'""

Hochman says he doesn't want to simply fill up prisons again.

""This is my message to people who believe in criminal justice reform: I believe in it as well,"" Hochman said. ""The difference between myself and my predecessor is it won't be a bunch of talk.""

Hochman's victory Nov. 5 to become top prosecutor in the nation's most populous county of 10 million people reflected growing discontent in California with progressive district attorneys who have pushed criminal justice reform.

Gascón, a former San Francisco police chief, was elected in 2020 during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota as part of a wave of progressive prosecutors elected nationwide.

He brought several controversial changes to the district attorney's office that were seen by critics as soft on crime, such as ending cash bail and not allowing prosecutors to charge juveniles as adults or ask for sentencing enhancements. He also recently addressed the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, saying he would seek resentencing for the brothers who received life sentences for the shotgun killings of their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1989.

Gascón defended his work, saying in his concession statement: ""I'm deeply proud of what we've accomplished over the past four years and grateful to the communities who have been and will always be the heart of criminal justice reform.""

In 2014, Gascón, then district attorney in San Francisco, co-authored a ballot measure passed by California voters that reclassified certain low-level drug and property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. The measure was approved as California spent years struggling with a 2009 federal court order to reduce the population in the state's overcrowded prisons.

But increased property crime in LA County, emphasized by viral videos of smash-and-grab retail theft, as well as a worsening drug epidemic and increasing homelessness have fed a feeling of lawlessness and frustration that voters brought to the polls last week.

Prosecutors across the state are now armed with the passage this month of Proposition 36, a ballot measure that gives them the ability to charge shoplifting and drug possession crimes as felonies after a third offense.

Hochman declined to say whether his office plans to review current misdemeanor cases to elevate them to felonies but said the ultimate goal is deterrence. His goal is to return to a year like 2014, which he said was considered the region's safest year in the last 50 years.

""I don't predict that you're going to have thousands of people now going to prison,"" he said. ""The goal is ultimately to deter them from committing the crimes in the first place. That's when I'll know that I'm actually doing something that is effective in the criminal justice system, not by filling prisons to the breaking point. That's a failure of the system.""

With a little over two weeks before being sworn into office and taking over a department of more than 700 prosecutors, Hochman spent a recent morning this week in Hermosa Beach, a city south of Los Angeles, observing ""homeless court.""

The program, which began in the coastal city of Redondo Beach, gives people experiencing homelessness the opportunity to avoid prosecution for nonviolent misdemeanor charges or municipal code violations in exchange for accepting judge-mandated services that can eventually lead to placement in housing.

""I thought it was a really innovative way to try and deal with low-level homeless crime ... and get the homeless individuals the help that they need to ensure that they actually won't ever have to be back in court,"" Hochman said.",,2024-11-15,

That means bringing back gang-related sentencing enhancements, allowing prosecutors to file juvenile charges more freely, and having prosecutors attend parole hearings with victims' families again, where they can help argue against the release of convicts, Hochman said.

The former Republican-turned-independent also plans to return to prosecuting low-level nonviolent crimes that he said the current district attorney has not, such as criminal threats, trespassing, disturbing the peace and loitering, which often involve those experiencing homelessness.

Anyone who breaks the law will receive ""proportional"" consequences -- no more ""get out of jail free"" cards, Hochman said in the interview Wednesday.

At the same time, he wants to look at solutions that don't necessarily involve locking criminals up, such as court-mandated drug treatment, community service, and restitution.

""There's a culture of lawlessness"" that has been ""perpetrated"" by Gascón's office, Hochman said.

""We're going to reverse that,"" he said. ""You basically say, 'Here are the lines in our society, the lines are the laws, I'm going to consistently, fairly and impartially enforce them and here the real consequences on the other side. So if you want to, test me. If you think I'm bluffing, I'm not bluffing.'""

So if you want to, test me. If you think I'm bluffing, I'm not bluffing.'""

Hochman says he doesn't want to simply fill up prisons again.

""This is my message to people who believe in criminal justice reform: I believe in it as well,"" Hochman said. ""The difference between myself and my predecessor is it won't be a bunch of talk.""

Hochman's victory Nov. 5 to become top prosecutor in the nation's most populous county of 10 million people reflected growing discontent in California with progressive district attorneys who have pushed criminal justice reform.

Gascón, a former San Francisco police chief, was elected in 2020 during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota as part of a wave of progressive prosecutors elected nationwide.

He brought several controversial changes to the district attorney's office that were seen by critics as soft on crime, such as ending cash bail and not allowing prosecutors to charge juveniles as adults or ask for sentencing enhancements. He also recently addressed the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, saying he would seek resentencing for the brothers who received life sentences for the shotgun killings of their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1989.

Gascón defended his work, saying in his concession statement: ""I'm deeply proud of what we've accomplished over the past four years and grateful to the communities who have been and will always be the heart of criminal justice reform.""

In 2014, Gascón, then district attorney in San Francisco, co-authored a ballot measure passed by California voters that reclassified certain low-level drug and property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. The measure was approved as California spent years struggling with a 2009 federal court order to reduce the population in the state's overcrowded prisons.

But increased property crime in LA County, emphasized by viral videos of smash-and-grab retail theft, as well as a worsening drug epidemic and increasing homelessness have fed a feeling of lawlessness and frustration that voters brought to the polls last week.

Prosecutors across the state are now armed with the passage this month of Proposition 36, a ballot measure that gives them the ability to charge shoplifting and drug possession crimes as felonies after a third offense.

Hochman declined to say whether his office plans to review current misdemeanor cases to elevate them to felonies but said the ultimate goal is deterrence. His goal is to return to a year like 2014, which he said was considered the region's safest year in the last 50 years.

""I don't predict that you're going to have thousands of people now going to prison,"" he said. ""The goal is ultimately to deter them from committing the crimes in the first place. That's when I'll know that I'm actually doing something that is effective in the criminal justice system, not by filling prisons to the breaking point. That's a failure of the system.""

With a little over two weeks before being sworn into office and taking over a department of more than 700 prosecutors, Hochman spent a recent morning this week in Hermosa Beach, a city south of Los Angeles, observing ""homeless court.""

The program, which began in the coastal city of Redondo Beach, gives people experiencing homelessness the opportunity to avoid prosecution for nonviolent misdemeanor charges or municipal code violations in exchange for accepting judge-mandated services that can eventually lead to placement in housing.

""I thought it was a really innovative way to try and deal with low-level homeless crime ... and get the homeless individuals the help that they need to ensure that they actually won't ever have to be back in court,"" Hochman said.",,2024-11-15,

That means bringing back gang-related sentencing enhancements, allowing prosecutors to file juvenile charges more freely, and having prosecutors attend parole hearings with victims' families again, where they can help argue against the release of convicts, Hochman said.

The former Republican-turned-independent also plans to return to prosecuting low-level nonviolent crimes that he said the current district attorney has not, such as criminal threats, trespassing, disturbing the peace and loitering, which often involve those experiencing homelessness.

Anyone who breaks the law will receive ""proportional"" consequences -- no more ""get out of jail free"" cards, Hochman said in the interview Wednesday.

At the same time, he wants to look at solutions that don't necessarily involve locking criminals up, such as court-mandated drug treatment, community service, and restitution.

""There's a culture of lawlessness"" that has been ""perpetrated"" by Gascón's office, Hochman said.

""You basically say, 'Here are the lines in our society, the lines are the laws, I'm going to consistently, fairly and impartially enforce them and here the real consequences on the other side. So if you want to, test me. If you think I'm bluffing, I'm not bluffing.'""

Hochman says he doesn't want to simply fill up prisons again.

""This is my message to people who believe in criminal justice reform: I believe in it as well,"" Hochman said. ""The difference between myself and my predecessor is it won't be a bunch of talk.""

Hochman's victory Nov. 5 to become top prosecutor in the nation's most populous county of 10 million people reflected growing discontent in California with progressive district attorneys who have pushed criminal justice reform.

Gascón, a former San Francisco police chief, was elected in 2020 during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota as part of a wave of progressive prosecutors elected nationwide.

He brought several controversial changes to the district attorney's office that were seen by critics as soft on crime, such as ending cash bail and not allowing prosecutors to charge juveniles as adults or ask for sentencing enhancements. He also recently addressed the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, saying he would seek resentencing for the brothers who received life sentences for the shotgun killings of their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1989.

Gascón defended his work, saying in his concession statement: ""I'm deeply proud of what we've accomplished over the past four years and grateful to the communities who have been and will always be the heart of criminal justice reform.""

In 2014, Gascón, then district attorney in San Francisco, co-authored a ballot measure passed by California voters that reclassified certain low-level drug and property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. The measure was approved as California spent years struggling with a 2009 federal court order to reduce the population in the state's overcrowded prisons.

But increased property crime in LA County, emphasized by viral videos of smash-and-grab retail theft, as well as a worsening drug epidemic and increasing homelessness have fed a feeling of lawlessness and frustration that voters brought to the polls last week.

Prosecutors across the state are now armed with the passage this month of Proposition 36, a ballot measure that gives them the ability to charge shoplifting and drug possession crimes as felonies after a third offense.

Hochman declined to say whether his office plans to review current misdemeanor cases to elevate them to felonies but said the ultimate goal is deterrence. His goal is to return to a year like 2014, which he said was considered the region's safest year in the last 50 years.

""I don't predict that you're going to have thousands of people now going to prison,"" he said. ""The goal is ultimately to deter them from committing the crimes in the first place. That's when I'll know that I'm actually doing something that is effective in the criminal justice system, not by filling prisons to the breaking point. That's a failure of the system.""

With a little over two weeks before being sworn into office and taking over a department of more than 700 prosecutors, Hochman spent a recent morning this week in Hermosa Beach, a city south of Los Angeles, observing ""homeless court.""

The program, which began in the coastal city of Redondo Beach, gives people experiencing homelessness the opportunity to avoid prosecution for nonviolent misdemeanor charges or municipal code violations in exchange for accepting judge-mandated services that can eventually lead to placement in housing.

""I thought it was a really innovative way to try and deal with low-level homeless crime ... and get the homeless individuals the help that they need to ensure that they actually won't ever have to be back in court,"" Hochman said.",,2024-11-15,

That means bringing back gang-related sentencing enhancements, allowing prosecutors to file juvenile charges more freely, and having prosecutors attend parole hearings with victims' families again, where they can help argue against the release of convicts, Hochman said.

The former Republican-turned-independent also plans to return to prosecuting low-level nonviolent crimes that he said the current district attorney has not, such as criminal threats, trespassing, disturbing the peace and loitering, which often involve those experiencing homelessness.

Anyone who breaks the law will receive ""proportional"" consequences -- no more ""get out of jail free"" cards, Hochman said in the interview Wednesday.

At the same time, he wants to look at solutions that don't necessarily involve locking criminals up, such as court-mandated drug treatment, community service, and restitution.

""There's a culture of lawlessness"" that has been ""perpetrated"" by Gascón's office, Hochman said.

The Tribune Content Agency

The Marin County Board of Supervisors is moving forward with due diligence in establishing a citizens oversight commission for the Marin Sheriff's Office.

The plan is to establish a nine-person committee that will address complaints and issues regarding the office's performance.

A state law, enacted following the national uproar over the 2020 Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd and racial profiling by law enforcement, set the stage for Marin to establish a citizens panel, including hiring staff for its role.

The supervisors' selection of the committee's members will be important. The committee has to reflect a reasonable diversity, representing different races, communities, ages and expertise.

The panel should also include some members who not only are knowledgeable of the perceived and real racial issues facing minorities when dealing with local law enforcement, as well as those who have law enforcement experience.

That's the county's stated goal. It won't be easy.

A panel dominated by reformers or members who reflect little diversity is going to undermine the constructive purpose of providing fair oversight. This is important to both those who see a need for greater oversight than the supervisors have provided, as well as those who support the ongoing work of the county's police force.

There is also a need to provide some guardrails, such as avoiding parallel investigations (like the sheriff's personnel reviews and the panel's work, for example). The panel can call for the sheriff to review a policy, incident or personnel matter, but it should first allow the sheriff to respond and complete his or her process. If the panel deems the sheriff's findings insufficient, it should take action.

Supervisors need to let the panel get started with its work, allowing it to build its agenda. They also need to be vigilant in overseeing its work and making changes when needed.

Certainly, there will be times when the sheriff feels that the commission is stepping on his toes, challenging his elected authority to manage his department.

The goal is to improve the department's engagement with the public, to build trust and accountability by answering questions regarding actions and policies. It should be an open and fair review.

There will be a learning process for the panel, the sheriff and deputies.

The overall goal is to improve law enforcement for all; that everyone, regardless of race or community, feels they are being fairly served and treated by the sheriff's department.

The county is at a point where it will begin the important process of picking the nine members. Those members will be involved in selecting an inspector general, the commission's lead staff member.

The county Board of Supervisors has had a reputation for having dozens of single-purpose boards and committees that operate below the public radar, even supervisors paying little attention or care regarding their function - or in same cases, dysfunction.

This panel needs to maintain a reasonably high public profile, including regular public progress reports to the board, keeping it visible and its actions accountable.",,2024-11-14,

The victims of a double homicide that occurred Wednesday morning in downtown San Diego were a husband and wife shot by a man who had been accused of domestic violence and sex crimes against the woman, police said Thursday.

The couple, identified by San Diego police as Rachael Martinez, 31, and Jose Medina, 39, were shot while they were sitting in a vehicle on Union Street, a few blocks north of the San Diego Central Courthouse.

The suspect, Christopher Farrell, 26, fled from the scene but was located by police about a mile away in Little Italy, where he allegedly fired at officers, striking a Harbor Police officer, before he was fatally shot by Harbor Police.

The Harbor Police officer, whose name has not been released, underwent surgery Wednesday and was recovering.

Martinez had had a prior relationship with Farrell, but on Oct. 4 she filed a report with the San Diego Police Department alleging domestic violence, including false imprisonment and sex crimes, police Lt. Daniel Meyer said Thursday in a release.

""The investigating officers obtained an emergency protective order,"" Meyer said.

The same day, officers located Farrell at a Metropolitan Transit System office in Barrio Logan where he worked as a security guard with Inter-Con Security, police said.

Farrell was fired, and his work firearm was confiscated. He was booked into San Diego County Jail.

However, as the investigation continued, ""the case had insufficient evidence and corroboration to immediately move forward,"" Meyer said.

On Oct. 7 Martinez was granted a temporary restraining order against Farrell, Meyer said. It was unclear at the time of the shooting if Farrell had been served with the restraining order.

According to court records, a hearing regarding the restraining order was scheduled for Wednesday.

""It appears likely that Martinez and Medina had arrived near the courthouse for the purpose of attending the restraining order hearing,"" Meyer said.

The investigation into the incident is ongoing, as is the police shooting that killed Farrell.

Farrell had fled the downtown homicide scene on foot, police said, and reloaded his weapon. A passerby spotted Farrell ducking behind an electrical box near Juniper Street and Kettner Boulevard and reported the man to Harbor Police officers who were nearby.

Farrell fired at the Harbor Police officers as they approached him, Meyer said, striking one in the hip.

Two Harbor Police officers fired their weapons at Farrell, who was struck multiple times, police said.

He was transported to a hospital but died.

Investigators located multiple folding knives, a handgun and multiple magazines at the scene.

The wounded officer, who did not open fire, is continuing to recover, Harbor Police Chief Magda Fernandez said in a statement Thursday afternoon.

Fernandez said ""his family are grateful for the support they are receiving and respectfully request privacy at this time as they process and begin healing from this traumatic incident.""

The officer had previously been employed with the San Diego Police Department but was hired onto the Harbor Police force in September, Meyer said.

The names of the officers who opened fire on Farrell also have not been released, but San Diego police officials said they 6- and 9-year veterans of the department.

By Thursday afternoon, a small memorial of candles, flowers and offerings of water and fruit had appeared on Union Street.

The candles had been lit.",,2024-11-15,

Through an open passenger door, the officer asked the driver, ""Are you okay?"" He then asked the driver to get out of the vehicle and told the driver they were concerned about his welfare.

The suspect then got out of the vehicle. The second officer, who was near the driver side door, told the suspect he was trying to make contact with him for several minutes. He also asked the suspect to come towards the back of the vehicle to make sure he was okay.

With three dead, including the shooting suspect, and a Harbor Police officer hospitalized with a gunshot wound, San Diego's homicide unit provided details of the department's criminal investigation of the broad-daylight killings.

SDPD Lt. Jud Campbell spoke to the media at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday near the intersection of Juniper Street and Kettner Boulevard, where a 26-year-old man was killed when two Harbor Police officers returned fire after their colleague, who did not discharge his weapon, was hit by a bullet in the thigh.

Campbell said the two victims, a 39-year-old man and a woman, 31, were inside a car when they were shot at around 8:22 a.m. Arriving officers pulled them both out of the vehicle but were unable to save them with CPR.

With it being so early in the investigation, there were many details Campbell declined to divulge.

However, ""I will say this: This was not a random attack. We do believe this was targeted,"" Campbell said.

A colleague of Campbell's, homicide Capt. Manuel del Toro, also spoke about the relationships of the victims and their killer.

""We think that the three knew each other and that there was also a motive for this,"" del Toro said in Spanish. ""He shot many times there with a lot of hatred and aimed at the two of them, so we think there is a connection. That is what we are investigating.""

The gunman who targeted them, the officer said, was wearing a hat, green shirt and blue jeans, a description sent out to all the units in the area and a police helicopter, which quickly began broadcasting the suspect's description.

""Obviously, when two people are shot in daylight like this, we want to get that out to as many people as possible,"" Campbell said.

Two Harbor Police were in the area, at Juniper and Kettner, Campbell said, when a citizen flagged them down around 9:06 a.m.

""Essentially what he described was: He had seen a male duck behind an electrical box,"" Campbell said. ""That drew his attention to the male. He listened to the announcement from [police helicopter] ABLE ... and realized this is probably the person who police are looking for.""

Four Harbor Police officers moved into the area and quickly began issuing commands to the man hidden behind the electrical box.

""As they were doing that, it appears the suspect began firing at them, multiple rounds,"" Campbell said. ""Two of the officers returned fire, striking the suspect, and, as you know, one of the Harbor Police officers was struck in the thigh area.""

The suspect, who was shot multiple times, was taken to the hospital, where he subsequently died of his injuries.

Campbell said a firearm, which appears to be a semi-automatic handgun, was found at the scene, as were discharged shell casings. The lieutenant also said investigators have taken statements from the dozens of witnesses who were in the area, and are also gathering video surveillance. Two separate homicide teams, one at each shooting scene, are conducting the investigation.

""Our goal is to know what happened and why,"" Campbell said.

SDPD believes that everybody involved has been positively identified and that they are all San Diegans.

San Diego Police are investigating a deadly shooting in broad daylight Wednesday in San Diego's Little Italy neighborhood that was followed by a shootout involving police a short while later.

Officers were called to Ash and Union streets around 8:20 a.m. Police at first confirmed that one person had died, and, later, said a second victim was killed as well.

Don Stevenson told NBC 7 that he witnessed the incident near Ash Street.

""I was pulling up to a job site,"" Stevenson said, ""a guy walked up to a car and shot and killed two people and took off running.""

About 45 minutes into the investigation of that shooting, San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl said at a news conference held around 10 a.m., officers from the San Diego Harbor Police who were in the area assisting in the suspect search located him about a mile away, in the 2200 block of Kettner Boulevard, close to Juniper Street. The suspect fired at the police, Wahl said, and shot an officer in the hip.

""We believe he's going to be OK, but his status is unknown,"" Wahl said.

The second shooting took place not far from the popular Crack Shack restaurant. An employee of the eatery said they heard the shots and dived to the ground for their safety, remaining there for about 40 minutes. A worker also showed NBC 7 photos of their car, hit by gunfire.

Police then returned fire and struck the suspect, who has also been taken to the hospital. The department's homicide captain told NBC 7 later in the morning that the suspect had also died.

""The motive and the reason behind this shooting is completely unknown at this point,"" Wahl said, adding that he had no information yet on the suspect's identity.

Due to an ongoing police investigation, please avoid the following areas due to road closures for the next several hours:

""I want to put out to the public that there is no further threat to the community,"" Wahl said, ""that we have everybody that was involved in this initial shooting incident.""

Wahl began the news conference by saying that the situation could have been much worse.

""This is Little Italy,"" Wahl said. ""We have people walking the streets, coffee shops.""

Police are urging residents to avoid the area of both shootings while the investigation is still active.

The officer who was shot was taken to the UC San Diego Medical Center in Hillcrest for treatment.

Around 1 p.m., Harbor Police Chief Magda Fernandez provided an update on the condition of the officer.

""I did speak to him before he went into surgery,"" said Fernandez, who declined to identify the lawman at this time. ""He was awake, he was alert and he was in good spirits.""

The officer, who has only been with the Harbor Police for three months and is currently in field training, is now recovering after surgery, which was completed around noon.

""I will tell you that the actions of all officers on scene saved lives today,"" Fernandez said, saying that Wednesday's incident was a prime example of the dangers the police face every day.",,2024-11-14,

About 45 minutes into the investigation of that shooting, San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl said at a news conference held around 10 a.m., officers from the San Diego Harbor Police who were in the area assisting in the suspect search located him about a mile away, in the 2200 block of Kettner Boulevard, close to Juniper Street. The suspect fired at the police, Wahl said, and shot an officer in the hip.

""We believe he's going to be OK, but his status is unknown,"" Wahl said.

The second shooting took place not far from the popular Crack Shack restaurant. An employee of the eatery said they heard the shots and dived to the ground for their safety, remaining there for about 40 minutes. A worker also showed NBC 7 photos of their car, hit by gunfire.

Police then returned fire and struck the suspect, who has also been taken to the hospital. The department's homicide captain told NBC 7 later in the morning that the suspect had also died.

""The motive and the reason behind this shooting is completely unknown at this point,"" Wahl said, adding that he had no information yet on the suspect's identity.

Due to an ongoing police investigation, please avoid the following areas due to road closures for the next several hours:

""I want to put out to the public that there is no further threat to the community,"" Wahl said, ""that we have everybody that was involved in this initial shooting incident.""

Wahl began the news conference by saying that the situation could have been much worse.

""This is Little Italy,"" Wahl said. ""We have people walking the streets, coffee shops.""

Police are urging residents to avoid the area of both shootings while the investigation is still active.

The officer who was shot was taken to the UC San Diego Medical Center in Hillcrest for treatment.

Around 1 p.m., Harbor Police Chief Magda Fernandez provided an update on the condition of the officer.

""I did speak to him before he went into surgery,"" said Fernandez, who declined to identify the lawman at this time. ""He was awake, he was alert and he was in good spirits.""

The officer, who has only been with the Harbor Police for three months and is currently in field training, is now recovering after surgery, which was completed around noon.

""I will tell you that the actions of all officers on scene saved lives today,"" Fernandez said, saying that Wednesday's incident was a prime example of the dangers the police face every day.",,2024-11-14,

With three dead, including the shooting suspect, and a Harbor Police officer hospitalized with a gunshot wound, San Diego's homicide unit provided details of the department's criminal investigation of the broad-daylight killings.

SDPD Lt. Jud Campbell spoke to the media at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday near the intersection of Juniper Street and Kettner Boulevard, where a 26-year-old man was killed when two Harbor Police officers returned fire after their colleague, who did not discharge his weapon, was hit by a bullet in the thigh.

Campbell said the two victims, a 39-year-old man and a woman, 31, were inside a car when they were shot at around 8:22 a.m. Arriving officers pulled them both out of the vehicle but were unable to save them with CPR.

With it being so early in the investigation, there were many details Campbell declined to divulge.

However, ""I will say this: This was not a random attack. We do believe this was targeted,"" Campbell said.

A colleague of Campbell's, homicide Capt. Manuel del Toro, also spoke about the relationships of the victims and their killer.

""We think that the three knew each other and that there was also a motive for this,"" del Toro said in Spanish. ""He shot many times there with a lot of hatred and aimed at the two of them, so we think there is a connection. That is what we are investigating.""

The gunman who targeted them, the officer said, was wearing a hat, green shirt and blue jeans, a description sent out to all the units in the area and a police helicopter, which quickly began broadcasting the suspect's description.

""Obviously, when two people are shot in daylight like this, we want to get that out to as many people as possible,"" Campbell said.

Two Harbor Police were in the area, at Juniper and Kettner, Campbell said, when a citizen flagged them down around 9:06 a.m.

""Essentially what he described was: He had seen a male duck behind an electrical box,"" Campbell said. ""That drew his attention to the male. He listened to the announcement from [police helicopter] ABLE ... and realized this is probably the person who police are looking for.""

Four Harbor Police officers moved into the area and quickly began issuing commands to the man hidden behind the electrical box.

""As they were doing that, it appears the suspect began firing at them, multiple rounds,"" Campbell said. ""Two of the officers returned fire, striking the suspect, and, as you know, one of the Harbor Police officers was struck in the thigh area.""

The suspect, who was shot multiple times, was taken to the hospital, where he subsequently died of his injuries.

Campbell said a firearm, which appears to be a semi-automatic handgun, was found at the scene, as were discharged shell casings. The lieutenant also said investigators have taken statements from the dozens of witnesses who were in the area, and are also gathering video surveillance. Two separate homicide teams, one at each shooting scene, are conducting the investigation.

""Our goal is to know what happened and why,"" Campbell said.

SDPD believes that everybody involved has been positively identified and that they are all San Diegans.

San Diego Police are investigating a deadly shooting in broad daylight Wednesday in San Diego's Little Italy neighborhood that was followed by a shootout involving police a short while later.

Officers were called to Ash and Union streets around 8:20 a.m. Police at first confirmed that one person had died, and, later, said a second victim was killed as well.

With three dead, including the shooting suspect, and a Harbor Police officer hospitalized with a gunshot wound, San Diego's homicide unit provided details of the department's criminal investigation of the broad-daylight killings.

SDPD Lt. Jud Campbell spoke to the media at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday near the intersection of Juniper Street and Kettner Boulevard, where a 26-year-old man was killed when two Harbor Police officers returned fire after their colleague, who did not discharge his weapon, was hit by a bullet in the thigh.

Campbell said the two victims, a 39-year-old man and a woman, 31, were inside a car when they were shot at around 8:22 a.m. Arriving officers pulled them both out of the vehicle but were unable to save them with CPR.

With it being so early in the investigation, there were many details Campbell declined to divulge.

However, ""I will say this: This was not a random attack. We do believe this was targeted,"" Campbell said.

A colleague of Campbell's, homicide Capt. Manuel del Toro, also spoke about the relationships of the victims and their killer.

""We think that the three knew each other and that there was also a motive for this,"" del Toro said in Spanish. ""He shot many times there with a lot of hatred and aimed at the two of them, so we think there is a connection. That is what we are investigating.""

The gunman who targeted them, the officer said, was wearing a hat, green shirt and blue jeans, a description sent out to all the units in the area and a police helicopter, which quickly began broadcasting the suspect's description.

""Obviously, when two people are shot in daylight like this, we want to get that out to as many people as possible,"" Campbell said.

Two Harbor Police were in the area, at Juniper and Kettner, Campbell said, when a citizen flagged them down around 9:06 a.m.

""Essentially what he described was: He had seen a male duck behind an electrical box,"" Campbell said. ""That drew his attention to the male. He listened to the announcement from [police helicopter] ABLE ... and realized this is probably the person who police are looking for.""

Four Harbor Police officers moved into the area and quickly began issuing commands to the man hidden behind the electrical box.

""As they were doing that, it appears the suspect began firing at them, multiple rounds,"" Campbell said. ""Two of the officers returned fire, striking the suspect, and, as you know, one of the Harbor Police officers was struck in the thigh area.""

The suspect, who was shot multiple times, was taken to the hospital, where he subsequently died of his injuries.

Campbell said a firearm, which appears to be a semi-automatic handgun, was found at the scene, as were discharged shell casings. The lieutenant also said investigators have taken statements from the dozens of witnesses who were in the area, and are also gathering video surveillance. Two separate homicide teams, one at each shooting scene, are conducting the investigation.

""Our goal is to know what happened and why,"" Campbell said.

SDPD believes that everybody involved has been positively identified and that they are all San Diegans.

San Diego Police are investigating a deadly shooting in broad daylight Wednesday in San Diego's Little Italy neighborhood that was followed by a shootout involving police a short while later.

Officers were called to Ash and Union streets around 8:20 a.m. Police at first confirmed that one person had died, and, later, said a second victim was killed as well.

Don Stevenson told NBC 7 that he witnessed the incident near Ash Street.

""I was pulling up to a job site,"" Stevenson said, ""a guy walked up to a car and shot and killed two people and took off running.""

About 45 minutes into the investigation of that shooting, San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl said at a news conference held around 10 a.m., officers from the San Diego Harbor Police who were in the area assisting in the suspect search located him about a mile away, in the 2200 block of Kettner Boulevard, close to Juniper Street. The suspect fired at the police, Wahl said, and shot an officer in the hip.

""We believe he's going to be OK, but his status is unknown,"" Wahl said.

The second shooting took place not far from the popular Crack Shack restaurant. An employee of the eatery said they heard the shots and dived to the ground for their safety, remaining there for about 40 minutes. A worker also showed NBC 7 photos of their car, hit by gunfire.

Police then returned fire and struck the suspect, who has also been taken to the hospital. The department's homicide captain told NBC 7 later in the morning that the suspect had also died.

""The motive and the reason behind this shooting is completely unknown at this point,"" Wahl said, adding that he had no information yet on the suspect's identity.

Due to an ongoing police investigation, please avoid the following areas due to road closures for the next several hours:

""I want to put out to the public that there is no further threat to the community,"" Wahl said, ""that we have everybody that was involved in this initial shooting incident.""

Wahl began the news conference by saying that the situation could have been much worse.

""This is Little Italy,"" Wahl said. ""We have people walking the streets, coffee shops.""

Police are urging residents to avoid the area of both shootings while the investigation is still active.

The officer who was shot was taken to the UC San Diego Medical Center in Hillcrest for treatment.

Around 1 p.m., Harbor Police Chief Magda Fernandez provided an update on the condition of the officer.

""I did speak to him before he went into surgery,"" said Fernandez, who declined to identify the lawman at this time. ""He was awake, he was alert and he was in good spirits.""

The officer, who has only been with the Harbor Police for three months and is currently in field training, is now recovering after surgery, which was completed around noon.

""I will tell you that the actions of all officers on scene saved lives today,"" Fernandez said, saying that Wednesday's incident was a prime example of the dangers the police face every day.",,2024-11-14,
