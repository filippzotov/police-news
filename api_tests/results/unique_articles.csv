At the request of the Fairburn Police Department, GBI agents are investigating an officer involved shooting in Fairburn, Fulton County, GA. One man was shot and killed in the incident. A Coweta County Sheriff's Office K9 was shot and killed. One Coweta County deputy was injured in the incident.

Preliminary information indicates on Wednesday, November 13, 2024, at about 10:50 p.m., Coweta County Sheriff's Office deputies attempted to stop a car for a registration violation. The driver, later identified as Jason Andre Wilson, age 23, of Atlanta, GA, refused to stop. Coweta County deputies chased Wilson into Fulton County where they used a PIT maneuver to disable his car. The Coweta County Sheriff's Office notified the Fairburn Police Department about the incident and Fairburn officers responded to assist. As officers, deputies, and Coweta County K9 Titan approached Wilson's car, Wilson shot toward them with an AK pistol. The officers and deputies fired back, hitting and killing Wilson.

During the incident, Coweta County K9 Titan was shot and killed. One Coweta County deputy was also shot and wounded. He was taken to a local hospital for treatment and is expected to survive.

Wilson will be taken to the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office for an autopsy.

Police identified the pair Thursday afternoon as 31-year-old Rachael Martinez and 39-year-old Jose Medina.

Thursday night, their loved ones gathered at the scene of their murders for a small vigil, leaving flowers and candles to mark the spot where the two lost their lives.

RELATED: SDPD -- Shooting victims were 'likely' on way to restraining order hearing vs. man who killed them

The couple leaves behind four children; the oldest is 15, and the youngest is just 3 years old.

ABC 10News spoke with Rachael's sister, Charlene Martinez, at the vigil.

""They can't believe that it's true. Last night I was up until 3 in the morning because the babies were up and crying, like waking up,"" says Martinez about the couple's children.

Martinez says the family never saw this crime coming and wonders if the system failed her sister and husband.

Both reported the suspect, who Rachael once dated, saying he'd been harassing them. He had been arrested and accused of domestic violence, including false imprisonment and sex crimes.

Martinez says her sister was the family hostess and a fantastic cook, and her brother-in-law was the life of the party, who loved to grab the mic and sing at family gatherings.

The family's focus is now on the couple's four children, currently in the care of Rachael's sister.

""Just kissed them last night, gave them a kiss to everyone, and I told them 'I love you and your tía is going to be here,'"" says Martinez about her nieces and nephews.

SAN DIEGO (KGTV) - On Wednesday, a man named Jonathan saw, heard, and recorded the deadly officer-involved shooting involving a suspect and police in Little Italy.

""And he's just like avoiding them, and they're like 'Drop the weapon, drop the weapon,'"" Jonathan said.

He shared the video he recorded with ABC 10News after the incident.

""You actually see the shooter standing behind the gray boxes,"" Jonathan said.

Police said the suspect allegedly killed two people downtown earlier that morning before being cornered at Kettner and Juniper in Little Italy.

""As the trolley's passing, then you'll hear the gunshots fire,"" Jonathan said.

Jonathan told us his own safety was a top concern as shots were fired.

""Worrying about the trolley passing as well. That was a concern because we have a lot of friends that ride the trolley as well,"" Jonathan said.

I followed through with MTS about Jonathan's concern.

MTS told ABC 10News that an in-service trolley traveled through the area at the time of the shooting. It was checked out for visible damage, though none was reported.

ABC 10News spoke with Ray Shay, who was a former San Diego Police Department SWAT commanding officer and was a lethal force instructor at the regional police academy, on Thursday.

""We always trained police officers to look at the big picture. Focus on the threat but be aware of what's around you,"" Shay said.

RELATED: Man captures video of officer-involved shooting unfold in Little Italy

We spoke with him regarding how officers are trained to handle these standoffs and shootouts, in addition to the conditions that we could see in the video.

""Keep in mind, this armed suspect was basically in a cul-de-sac, commercial buildings. That is a good backdrop or field of fire,"" Shay said. ""So, with the trolley going behind, that is not necessarily a no-shoot.""

Shay also said the caliber of the weapons used by police could have played a factor as well.

""The caliber of the weapons firearms that officers on the scene were using were small caliber, meaning they do not have the power to punch through thick metal or to injure the people inside on the trolley,"" Shay said.

That appears evident in the video ABC 10News got on Thursday.

Here's a look at the utility box that the suspect was hiding behind at the time:

There are plenty of bullet holes from the gunfire, but no rounds appear to go through the metal.

ABC 10News reached out to the Port of San Diego and Harbor Police regarding the training or guidance officers receive when it comes to the backdrops and surroundings of a would-be gunfight with an armed possible suspect.

This statement is from Port of San Diego Harbor Police Chief Magda Fernandez:

""Per standard procedure in incidents like these, the San Diego Police Department is investigating whether our officers' actions were consistent with policy and law, and the San Diego County District Attorney will review the findings. In alignment with the Harbor Police Department's commitment to public safety and transparency, we are fully cooperating with the investigation.""",,2024-11-15,

Koren in a briefing Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024, offered more details on an officer-involved shooting on Tuesday.

A Metro officer shot and killed a man who called police about a home break-in while trying to wrestle a knife out of a home invader's hands Tuesday morning, as department officials offered more details on the incident today.

Bodycam footage presented by Metro shows Brandon Durham, 43, being shot several times in his home by 26-year-old officer Alexander Bookman in the 6900 block of Wine River Drive. Durham had called emergency services at 12:40 a.m. Tuesday and reported people were firing guns and attempting to break into his house, where he and his 15-year-old daughter were.

Officers responded to the scene and found cars with broken windows and kicked in the door to the residence after hearing screams coming from inside the home. After entering the home, Bookman turned a corner and saw Durham with 31-year-old Alejandro Budrauch, as the two were wrestling for control of a knife, according to police.

Bookman told the two to drop the knife before shooting Durham once. After Durham falls to the ground, Bookman fires five more rounds at the man, who was not moving, bodycam footage shows. Durham was pronounced dead at the scene.

Metro officials said they could not confirm whether Bookman knew Durham was the one who had placed the call before entering the home, and that no guns were found on the premises. Budrauch was arrested and booked on four charges, including home invasion with a deadly weapon and child abuse, neglect or endangerment.

Metro Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren said the investigation is still in the early stages and said it ""wasn't appropriate to speculate"" on the details of the case. Koren also asserted officers are often asked to make quick decisions based on their perceptions of threats.

""They don't have the ability to stop time, and stop the video, and get a still and then spend minutes, let alone hours or days or months, analyzing that information to make their decision,"" Koren said Thursday during a press conference. ""They have matter of seconds, if not split seconds, to make very challenging decisions.""

According to SDPD's press release, the victims who were found shot and killed in their car just a block up the road from the courthouse were identified as a married couple: 31-year-old Rachael Martinez and Jose Medina, 39. SDPD says the shooter, 26-year-old Christopher Farrell, had started dating Martinez in Aug. 2024, and she later filed a police report accusing him of domestic violence, false imprisonment and sex crimes on Oct. 4.

After the shooting near the courthouse, Farrell was ultimately confronted by police in Little Italy, where, after a shootout, he was shot and killed. A Harbor Police officer was also shot in that exchange but is now recovering.

RELATED: Man captures video of officer-involved shooting unfold in Little Italy

SDPD officers obtained an emergency protective order for Martinez following her Oct. 4 report. The initial investigation showed Farrell was a security guard for Inter-Con Security, which works with the Metropolitan Transit System on a contract basis. The press release says the officers responded to an MTS office at 1600 Newton Ave. and arrested Farrell, booking him into San Diego County Jail.

He was fired from his job, and his work weapon was taken from him, SDPD says.

A detective from SDPD's domestic violence unit took up the case, and he re-interviewed Martinez and consulted with a prosecutor specializing

in domestic violence, the department says.

SDPD says at that point, the case had ""insufficient evidence and corroboration to immediately move forward.""

On Oct. 7, Martinez was granted a temporary restraining order against Farrell; however, SDPD says it's unclear if he was ever served with the order.

The restraining order hearing was continued to Nov. 13, the day Martinez and Medina were gunned down.

RELATED: Neighbors react to Wednesday morning's shooting in downtown San Diego

""It appears likely that Martinez and Medina had arrived near the courthouse for the purpose of attending the restraining order hearing,"" SDPD's press release says.

ABC 10News has obtained the court document that shows Farrell was scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday for that restraining order hearing. According to the documents, Martinez and Medina filed the order against him. In her filing, Martinez says Farrell began harassing she and her husband once he learned she was married.

The court document states that one day in September, Martinez went to confront Farrell at his apartment, and once inside, she says he physically and sexually assaulted her.

SDPD says its detectives are continuing to investigate the case. If you have any information for police about this case, reach out to the homicide unit at 619-531-2293 or call Crime Stoppers at 888-580-8477.",,2024-11-15,

The situation unfolded on Friday, November 1 at 6:45 p.m. in the Carondelet neighborhood on Idaho Avenue.

Prior to the arrival of law enforcement, Flemming was reportedly making threats towards his mother and another woman. He was seen attempting to damage a gate to a vinyl fence using a hammer in a gangway. When the police arrived at the scene, Flemming started walking towards the officers while still holding the hammer despite being ordered to drop it.

In response to the perceived threat, a 30-year-old officer with over 6 years of experience fired a shot that struck Flemming in the leg. Another officer, also 30 years old but with 2 years of service, used a taser to subdue the teenager. Flemming was then taken to a hospital where he is currently in stable condition. Fortunately, no officers were harmed during the confrontation.

Due to the recent mental health crises exhibited by the suspect, an affidavit for a mandatory psychological evaluation was filed. The Circuit Attorney's Office has pressed charges against Flemming for unlawful use of a weapon and second-degree property damage.

It is essential to address the underlying mental health issues that contributed to this incident and ensure that individuals like Flemming receive the appropriate support and treatment needed to prevent such situations from reoccurring. Mental health crises can pose significant challenges for both law enforcement officers and the individuals involved, highlighting the importance of effective crisis intervention strategies and mental health resources within communities.

By raising awareness about mental health issues and promoting access to mental health services, we can work towards creating a safer and more supportive environment for everyone.

The victims of a double homicide that occurred Wednesday morning in downtown San Diego were a husband and wife shot by a man who had been accused of domestic violence and sex crimes against the woman, police said Thursday.

The couple, identified by San Diego police as Rachael Martinez, 31, and Jose Medina, 39, were shot while they were sitting in a vehicle on Union Street, a few blocks north of the San Diego Central Courthouse.

The suspect, Christopher Farrell, 26, fled from the scene but was located by police about a mile away in Little Italy, where he allegedly fired at officers, striking a Harbor Police officer, before he was fatally shot by Harbor Police.

The Harbor Police officer, whose name has not been released, underwent surgery Wednesday and was recovering.

Martinez had had a prior relationship with Farrell, but on Oct. 4 she filed a report with the San Diego Police Department alleging domestic violence, including false imprisonment and sex crimes, police Lt. Daniel Meyer said Thursday in a release.

""The investigating officers obtained an emergency protective order,"" Meyer said.

The same day, officers located Farrell at a Metropolitan Transit System office in Barrio Logan where he worked as a security guard with Inter-Con Security, police said.

Farrell was fired, and his work firearm was confiscated. He was booked into San Diego County Jail.

However, as the investigation continued, ""the case had insufficient evidence and corroboration to immediately move forward,"" Meyer said.

On Oct. 7 Martinez was granted a temporary restraining order against Farrell, Meyer said. It was unclear at the time of the shooting if Farrell had been served with the restraining order.

According to court records, a hearing regarding the restraining order was scheduled for Wednesday.

""It appears likely that Martinez and Medina had arrived near the courthouse for the purpose of attending the restraining order hearing,"" Meyer said.

The investigation into the incident is ongoing, as is the police shooting that killed Farrell.

Farrell had fled the downtown homicide scene on foot, police said, and reloaded his weapon. A passerby spotted Farrell ducking behind an electrical box near Juniper Street and Kettner Boulevard and reported the man to Harbor Police officers who were nearby.

Farrell fired at the Harbor Police officers as they approached him, Meyer said, striking one in the hip.

Two Harbor Police officers fired their weapons at Farrell, who was struck multiple times, police said.

He was transported to a hospital but died.

Investigators located multiple folding knives, a handgun and multiple magazines at the scene.

The wounded officer, who did not open fire, is continuing to recover, Harbor Police Chief Magda Fernandez said in a statement Thursday afternoon.

Fernandez said ""his family are grateful for the support they are receiving and respectfully request privacy at this time as they process and begin healing from this traumatic incident.""

The officer had previously been employed with the San Diego Police Department but was hired onto the Harbor Police force in September, Meyer said.

The names of the officers who opened fire on Farrell also have not been released, but San Diego police officials said they 6- and 9-year veterans of the department.

By Thursday afternoon, a small memorial of candles, flowers and offerings of water and fruit had appeared on Union Street.

Taya Boggs and Nora Schwartz sat at a kitchen table on Monday and watched surveillance video of their brother's last moments from January.

They still cannot fathom how the man who shot John Bartrom went free.

Bartrom, 46, was one of Kansas City's most-known businessmen as the owner and founder of Jericho Home Improvements.

His commercials became a staple on local Kansas City television and radio stations, including KMBC.

Bartrom grew up in Fort Wayne. He was the oldest sibling, son, uncle, and father. He was also a philanthropist and giver, according to his family.

""He loved so many around him,"" said Boggs, his sister. ""He took care of so many.""

So many people have also questioned why Bartrom was at the BP Gas Station at East 63rd Street and Prospect Avenue just past midnight on Jan. 7, 2024, and what led up to his death.

Bartrom's sisters on Monday spoke with KMBC 9 Investigates about the Kansas City police investigative file and surveillance video.

They know people have interest in the case. They want to use the interest to generate more tips and information.

They also want closure.

Bartrom's sisters still question why prosecutors never charged the shooter. They believe the Jackson County prosecutor's office made their brother look like an aggressor in a March statement, which they don't see based on their review of surveillance videos from the gas station.

The prosecutor's March statement said, ""Evidence showed the man who shot Bartrom fired a handgun after Bartrom struggled with the man and Bartrom tried to pull the man from his vehicle.""

""Our brother was murdered,"" said Schwartz, Bartrom's sister. ""And his case was closed as fast as you can possibly close a case.""

Jackson County prosecutors believe they have completed an extremely thorough legal review of the case multiple times. They also spoke with several members of Bartrom's family before announcing their charging decision to explain legal considerations in the case.

Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker declined to press charges in March, saying it is a case of self-defense.

The shooter told police during an interrogation he believed his life was in danger after Bartrom reached into his vehicle.

In a newly emailed statement on Wednesday, the prosecutor's office said their sympathies go out to Mr. Bartrom's family. The statement said prosecutors considered all evidence and applied the evidence to Missouri law.

""We do not like what happened, but due to Missouri's self-defense protections, we cannot ethically charge the case with the current evidence,"" the prosecutor's office said.

The Jackson County prosecutor's office also considered how the man fled the gas station after the shooting and initially did not admit his involvement. He eventually confirmed what happened after police presented pictures of the surveillance video showing him at the gas station. Still, prosecutors do not believe they have enough evidence to charge the man with a crime after he told Kansas City police he tried to defend his life after Bartrom reached into his vehicle.

They also believe surveillance video evidence does not disprove the man's self-defense claim beyond a reasonable doubt.

Bartrom's family still believes Kansas City police could have spoken to more people present at the gas station that early January morning to find answers surrounding what happened between John Bartrom and the man who shot him.

A KCPD spokesperson told KMBC 9 Investigates that police made several efforts to identify people at the gas station, but those attempts were unsuccessful. Prosecutors say they are always open to new tips.

The family still wonders what people heard or saw.

Video and case file show new perspective on John Bartrom's death

KMBC 9 Investigates and Bartrom's family obtained video, pictures, and the full investigative case file from Kansas City police through Missouri Sunshine requests.

Video shows Bartrom pulling up to a gas pump at the BP station just before 1 a.m., then stepping around the front of his white Range Rover to talk to a man in the driver's seat of a white Chevy Equinox.

KMBC is not naming the man since prosecutors have not charged him.

Bartrom appears to unscrew his gas cap, then returns to speak with the man in the Equinox.

The man eventually said in the Kansas City police interrogation room that Bartrom asked for cocaine and looked high.

KMBC asked Bartrom's sisters if he was at the gas station to buy drugs.

""We don't know,"" Boggs said. ""But what we do know is that there were no drugs found in his body. There were no drugs or paraphernalia found on his person, in his vehicle anywhere. Absolutely none. So maybe he was, but there's absolutely no proof of that.""

A toxicology report found alcohol in Bartrom's system, but no other prescription or illegal drugs.

A medical examiner's evidence report listed no drugs found in Bartrom's property, and a police report did not list any drugs found in his vehicle.

Kansas City emergency medical personnel that responded to the scene did treat Bartrom for a potential drug overdose with Narcan after receiving a call for a medical emergency.

But Bartrom was also suffering from a gunshot wound, at the time, unbeknownst to the first responders.

No one at the gas station had told police or EMS personnel they heard a gunshot.

Medics only found the single gunshot to Bartrom's lower left abdomen, after he was loaded into the ambulance.

He was pronounced dead at the hospital.

The sisters believe Bartrom stopped for gas since his gas tank was empty on the way to a casino, which he often frequented.

Surveillance video shows nearly 40 seconds after Bartrom and man in the Equinox start talking at the BP gas station, the man pulls away.

Bartrom is holding what appears to be cash and puts it on the ground.

A different surveillance angle shows the man back up toward Bartrom.

But Bartrom's sisters question what happened in those two minutes afterward.

""You don't see John trying to pull someone out of a vehicle,"" Schwartz said. ""I see the top of his head the entire time.""

KMBC 9 investigates zoomed in on a camera angle from the side of the building.

Bartrom's sisters believe the enhanced video gives them closure, showing their brother was not the bad guy. They question what evidence shows Bartrom tried to pull the shooter out of the SUV.

The shooter, during the police interrogation, told police Bartrom tried to reach into his car and grab him out.

Also, during the interrogation, he said he felt like his life was in danger, and he fired one shot from his gun and drove away.

""Did the shooter reach out to grab John's money? John tried to pull it back, and he didn't like it. So, he shot him?"" Schwartz said.

Castle doctrine and self defense considerations

Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker considered the entire case file along with a homicide committee of prosecutors working with Kansas City police detectives.

The prosecutor's office eventually declined charges based on Missouri's so-called ""castle doctrine.""

The law allows the use of lethal self-defense inside your home, private property, or vehicle if someone tries to unlawfully enter and use force against you.

For charges, Jackson County prosecutors would have had to disprove the claim of self-defense, while proving the elements of murder or manslaughter. Prosecutors considered murder or manslaughter charges. But they still believe the surveillance video did not disprove beyond a reasonable doubt the man's castle doctrine claim.

When asked about Mr. Bartrom's family's concerns, the prosecutor's office said in the emailed statement, ""They and the community should be assured that we have carefully reviewed this case, more than once.""

Still, Boggs and Schwartz believe police could have done more investigation.

Boggs and Schwartz saw on video a man pumping gas turn his head after the shooting, who may have heard something. They also said multiple other people were at the gas station during the shooting.

Kansas City police did not return emails from KMBC 9 Investigates asking for more information about their questioning of witnesses at the gas station.

""What are we missing?"" Boggs said. ""All the police reports that we've read, the video that we've seen, how can we come to this conclusion that is the castle doctrine so quickly without doing more?""

Kansas City police in an emailed statement said some potential witnesses were no longer on scene once police arrived.

KCPD spokeswoman Alayna Gonzalez said they made several efforts to identify potential witnesses at the gas station at the time of the homicide however ""those efforts were unsuccessful."" They also asked for help from the media to ask the community for tips through the TIPS Hotline.

When asked specifically about images from the surveillance video being used to identify witnesses, Gonzalez said, ""All available information that could be gathered via surveillance footage was collected and reviewed.""

She said the footage can be used for a variety of reasons to identify victims, witnesses, suspects, timelines and chronology of events.

Gonzalez said police also asked for help from the media to ask the community for tips through the TIPS Hotline.

""In this particular case no witnesses have come forward that would have been able to provide additional firsthand information in regard to the homicide,"" s ""We also have a great working relationship with the prosecutor's office who remain in contact with detectives throughout the course of an investigation to ensure we can present the best case for charging consideration.""

Prosecutors said they would take more information from any individual with tips on the case.

""As in any homicide, we would review any new evidence made available to our office,"" the prosecutor's office statement said.

The sisters, meanwhile, are asking anyone else with information to come forward.

""He can't speak for himself,"" Schwartz said. ""So, anything else, even for us as a family, if we could hear any of your part of that evening, it might give us a little more closure.""

The report, released Thursday, was in response to the 2022 death of a man incarcerated at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln. The man, referred to in the report as ""John Doe,"" was found dead in his cell just three days after he was assigned a new cellmate, referred to in the report as ""John Smith.""

Both men were in longer term restrictive housing, a solitary-like housing assignment used if staff determine an incarcerated person is a risk to themselves or others. Because of space constraints, those placed in restrictive housing are sometimes paired up -- or double bunked -- as cellmates. Staff members are required to assess if the potential cellmates pose a risk to one another before approving the match.

As of 2024, according to the report, the Nebraska State Penitentiary is the only state prison to utilize double-bunking in restrictive housing units.

In Thursday's report, the inspector general called for double-bunking to be suspended across all state correctional facilities -- a recommendation that was also made in the inspector general's annual reports from 2017, 2018 and 2019. The previous recommendations were either rejected by the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services or did not require a response from the agency.

""Restrictive housing is a volatile setting, even for a correctional facility, and staff cannot be expected to determine which cellmates are safe and which ones are not in these circumstances,"" the report said.

Officials with the department of corrections said they would consider the inspector general's recommendations.

Staff recommended Doe be removed from restrictive housing prior to his death

Between 2018, when Doe was first incarcerated, and 2022, when he died, Doe was repeatedly found with homemade alcohol, cigarettes and synthetic marijuana, according to the report. Prior to his last placement in restrictive housing, he spent two three-month stints in what he called ""the hole"" after suspected weapons were found in his cell.

In mid-2022, according to the report, a staff member saw Doe take a makeshift weapon from another inmate. When searched, staff recovered a 5-inch homemade weapon from Doe's pocket. He was placed into a short-term restrictive housing placement before being moved to long-term restrictive housing.

About two months into his placement, staff members recommended that Doe be removed from long-term restrictive housing, noting that he was progressing well -- but when his case went to the department's multi-disciplinary review team, they ordered that he stay in restrictive housing. Near the end of 2022, Doe was preparing to go in front of the review board for a second time, and staff were again set to recommend that he be removed from restrictive housing.

""I really do want to make a change and I am not saying that just to get out of the hole, I really do want to change my life around and educate myself more and become a better person for myself and my son,"" Doe wrote in an accountability statement ahead of his second review board meeting, according to the report.

The review would never occur. Six days before Doe was set to go in front of the review board, according to the report, Smith -- who was housed with a different cellmate in restrictive housing for the prior 100 days -- specifically requested to be housed with Doe. Staff reported that they asked Doe if he was okay with the arrangement, and he said yes.

One day before to Doe's death, a case manager spoke with both Doe and Smith separately to check in on the new cellmates, and neither expressed any concerns, according to the report.

At 4 p.m. the next day, Doe was found unresponsive on the ground of his cell. His cause of death was determined to be asphyxia with a ligature. The inspector general was notified of the death within ""a few hours,"" according to the report, via an email with the inmate's name and the subject line ""NSP suicide,"" though the report notes there is now an ongoing criminal case in connection with Doe's death.

Three double-bunked inmates in restrictive housing died since 2017

Inspector General Doug Koebernick declined to confirm the identities of Doe and Smith. But the case has many similarities with the death of Philip Garcia, who was placed in restrictive housing at the Nebraska State Penitentiary before his death on Oct. 29, 2022.

Earlier this year, a grand jury in Lancaster County indicted Garcia's cellmate, Tyler Stanford, on one count of first-degree murder in connection with Garcia's death. According to reporting from the Lincoln Journal Star, Garcia was found unresponsive in his restrictive housing cell, on his back with his legs crossed and a bedsheet tied around his neck. The cell was in disarray as if there had been a struggle, and Stanford repeatedly said in a jail call to his mother that he ""just blacked out"" on the day of Garcia's death.

If Stanford is convicted in Garcia's death, it would mark the third killing of an inmate in restrictive housing by their cellmate since 2017.

In 2017, 22-year-old inmate Terry Berry at Tecumseh State Correctional Institution was strangled to death by his cellmate, Patrick Schroeder. A report on the death the inspector general issued found that Schroeder and Berry had been double-bunked in restrictive housing as a form of punishment, and the proper protocols to determine if the two men would be a risk to one another were not followed.

Schroeder was sentenced to death for killing Berry, but he killed himself in 2022 while on death row. The state later paid Berry's family nearly half of a million dollars to settle a lawsuit.

In 2020, at the Nebraska State Penitentiary, 20-year-old Kevin Carter was beaten and strangled to death by his cellmate in restrictive housing, Angelo Bol. This summer, Bol was found not responsible for Carter's death by reason of insanity. A federal civil rights lawsuit against the state brought by Carter's family is ongoing.

Corrections department says it will 'consider' recommendations

The inspector general's report contains a total of eight recommendations -- first recommending that Nebraska Department of Correctional Services stop double-bunking in restrictive housing units altogether and change department policy to explicitly prohibit the practice.

Under current policy, according to the report, double-bunking in restrictive housing is permitted ""so long as the cell assignment provides each cellmate with reasonable safety from assault."" The policy further notes that ""reasonable safety is not a guarantee of absolute safety.""

According to the report, multiple staff members the Inspector General's Office interviewed expressed concerns about the practice of double-bunking in restrictive housing units. The staff members said they had limited access to information about the individuals being placed together and felt pressured to double-bunk despite their concerns. A month before the 2022 death, staff were directed in writing to pair up as many people in restrictive housing as possible in order to ""free up as many cells as possible,"" according to the report.

If the department of corrections continues double-bunking, the inspector general recommended that there be more oversight of cellmate placements by including the multidisciplinary review team in placement decisions and/or requiring warden-level approval for double-bunking placements. Additional training for staff who work in restrictive housing and similar units was also recommended.

On Thursday, Bartley talked about the controversy that might have cost her the City Hall job she now holds if not for ""the grace we give each other when we're in tense moments,"" she said. She's ""learned a ton,"" she said, since making the transition from a community organizer demanding change to a City Hall insider with power to make things happen.

""I was analyzing budget after budget, seeing the gutting or underfunding or all-the-way decimation of affordable and public housing, mental health services, community safety, ... [and] of good schools. I thought it was important to turn peoples' attention to how underfunded these key services that bring community safety were,"" Bartley said.

""When I was working outside of City Hall, that allowed me to talk to certain communities in a particular way to learn from those communities to bring those learnings into my work. That constituency ... of people that I've learned from has significantly grown and, frankly, in ways I didn't expect. So my world view is growing and developing alongside that.""

Her comments about defunding police came in February, less than three months before joining the Johnson administration.

Police reform advocates now accuse the mayor of defunding the Chicago Police Department for the second straight year -- this time by cutting 456 police vacancies in a way that would decimate spending and staff within the office leading the Chicago Police Department's court-ordered reform push.

Johnson's proposed $17.3 billion budget includes a 45% cut -- from $6.7 million to $3.7 million -- in the budget for CPD's Office of Constitutional Policing, charged with implementing the reforms, which have been mandated under a federal consent decree.

Staffing in the Office of Constitutional Policing would be cut more than in half -- from 65 budgeted employees to 28. Equally controversial is a proposed 28% cut in the budget of CPD's Training and Support Group. That section would lose 90 jobs.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul has warned Chicago risks being held in contempt of court.

With talks continuing between the Law Department and the Attorney General's office, Bartley wouldn't say if cuts in police reform would be reversed. All she would say is that every city department was asked to cut its budget by at least 3%, and CPD was no exception.

""We all have to dig a little deeper ... in this moment. ... Department heads had the discretion to identify where cuts could be strategically made ... that allowed them to still fulfill their missions,"" she said.

CPD has been under federal court oversight since a U.S. Justice Department investigation triggered by the police shooting of Laquan McDonald.

Three years into that process, the city was granted a three-year extension -- until 2027. The latest report issued by the team monitoring the department's progress found it had fully complied with only 7% of consent decree provisions by the end of 2023.

To reach full compliance, CPD first must create policy, then train officers on the policy and implement the changes.

""We recognize the importance of the consent decree. Many of us fought for it. Many of us fought for the implementation of it,"" Bartley said.

Johnson would not be digging out of nearly as big a budget hole if Chicago voters had approved the binding referendum known as ""Bring Chicago Home.""

It would have authorized the City Council to raise the real estate transfer tax on high-end property transactions to generate as much as $100 million in annual revenue to combat homelessness.

Bartley said she would like to see the mayor try again to win support from Chicago voters, perhaps with a more clearly-worded referendum that's less confusing to voters.

""You're never going to catch me say that we shouldn't try for progressive revenue. I believe in it. The mayor believes in it and we are steadfast in making it happen,"" she said.

""As organizers, we aren't used to winning a lot -- especially on the first time. But we're used to rolling up our sleeves and getting back out there and trying again.""",,2024-11-14,

(KDKA) -- Two men are facing homicide and robbery charges in connection with a fatal shooting in New Castle last month, police announced on Thursday.

New Castle police said officers have arrested and charged Jason Jones Jr. and Louis Brewer in the death of Terry Micco on Oct. 18.

A witness told police he found Micco bleeding on the ground and saw two men running away after he heard gunshots inside a home on Waldo Street and went to see what happened the afternoon of Oct. 18, according to CBS affiliate WKBN. Micco was taken to the hospital, where he died, the TV station said.

Police said the shooting was likely the result of a drug-related robbery, and court paperwork said suspected drugs, cash and a cell phone were found in Micco's truck, WKBN reported.

Citing the affidavit, WKBN reported that Jones told police that they went to meet Micco at the home where he was shot because the other suspect said he ""had bricks.""

Jones told police there were other people and a gun in the house and he ""felt like he had to defend himself,"" so when Micco was walking out the back door, he shot him, according to WKBN. Jones said the other suspect ""got dome drugs off of Micco"" but didn't see what, WKBN said.

""The arrests were brought to fruition by the tenacious and cooperative work of the New Castle and Lawrence County District Attorney Criminal Investigators, which are now merged into one unit,"" New Castle police wrote on Facebook.

Police also thanked the Sharon Police Department for their help with the arrests.

Zephyrhills police have arrested a suspect on a manslaughter charge in connection to a fatal shooting early Thursday.

Officers responded about 12:15 a.m. to a disturbance call at a home in the 7000 block of Steer Blade Drive in the Silverado subdivision and found a 40-year-old man with a gunshot wound, according to the Zephyrhills Police Department.

But this year's event, marking 49 years since the signing of that treaty, was overshadowed by the fatal police shooting in Salluit last week.

Hundreds of people gathered across Nunavik on Monday to pay tribute to Joshua Papigatuk, who was killed during that confrontation.

Quebec's police watchdog, Bureau des enquêtes indépendantes (BEI), is still investigating that shooting, and will not release any more findings before the end of its investigation. It's the 15th police-related death in Nunavik since 2017.

The agreement was Canada's first modern Indigenous land claims treaty. It heralded a new era for Nunavimmiut to get more self-governance, including in policing.

Charlie Watt was one of the negotiators.

""Our vision back then was for the Inuit to take complete control over the police force, in other words running the police and become police themselves,"" he said.

Charlie Watt is a former senator who helped negotiate the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. That was signed in 1975. (Submitted by the Makivik Corporation)

He believes the JBNQA isn't being properly implemented in numerous areas -- not just in policing.

""The government of Quebec is trying to dictate to us what we should be doing and how we should be handling our life,"" he said.

""Inuit need to have to have their own governance in order to be able to make changes and positive changes to their life ... to be able to make laws.""

'Significant changes' to policing in Nunavik from agreement

According to Nunavik Police Service's website, the 1975 signing of the JBNQA brought significant changes in Nunavik.

""An agreement was made between the Sûreté du Québec and the First Nations to implement an Aboriginal police program,"" it said.

Inuit who completed the program became special constables.

That police division then transitioned to the Kativik Regional Police Force in 1995, providing the police service full autonomy. It was rebranded to the Nunavik Police Service in 2021 -- the name the region's police bears today.

Justice advocate Suzy Kauki, who's based in Kuujjuaq, remembers seeing far more Inuit officers on the streets as a young girl.

According to data from the police service, three of 79 officers were Inuit in 2018.

As of September 2024, only two of 125 NPS officers were Inuit.

She believes that's a result of ""how hard it is to be a police officer in your own community and be confronted with all the trauma we have.""

""The decline of Inuit in that model is because of administrative systems failing to follow the ethnic agreement of our modern treaty,"" Kauki said.

Western policing model, rather than Inuit

Mylène Jaccoud is a professor of criminology at Université de Montréal, and was in charge of Indigenous policing issues in the Viens Commission inquiry. That was launched in 2016 by the former provincial Liberal government after allegations of police misconduct against Indigenous women.

Jaccoud said the NPS isn't as autonomous as many had hoped for, even with oversight from the Kativik Regional Government, the regional authority over most of Nunavik.

Firstly, she said police officers come largely from outside of Nunavik, fresh out of the national policing school in Quebec.

""I think this is the one of the biggest problems that we have in the North, people coming up very young and trying to enforce the law,"" she said.

She also appreciates that new recruits can feel isolated in these small communities, which is why she said staff retention and adequate cultural training is vital.

Ultimately, she said the problem can't be solved by simply throwing more money at the issue.

During the Viens Commission inquiry, she tried to recommend a new way of policing -- one that allows Indigenous communities to run their own policing.

""It's not about the ability to deal with the budget and financial resources ... you just end up with the power of dealing with bad resources,"" she said.

""We should implement another model of policing ... in the Aboriginal mentality and cultural mind of Aboriginal people.""

For Charlie Watt, that is the true meaning of self-determination.

""We have a constitutional right to exist,"" he said, pointing to Section 35 of the Constitution which reaffirms the existing Indigenous and treaty rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada.

""That needs to be respected.""

Minnie Grey believes programs like Saqijuq, which means ""a change in wind direction"" in Inuktitut, can play a big role in the discussion about Inuit self-determination. (Submitted by Minnie Grey)

Pairing social workers with police in Puvirnituq

One current model of policing Jaccoud said is the Saqijuq program, which means ""a change in wind direction"" in Inuktitut.

In particular, Jaccoud points to their mobile intervention teams in Puvirnituq, which she believes can help build trust with police.

Saqijuq board member Minnie Grey said there are two teams, pairing one police officer with a social worker. The teams respond to most calls for police assistance, which aren't dangerous criminal incidents in nature.

""It's a really good way of interacting and getting to know people on a personal level, instead of being seen as an outsider that comes in and intervenes in criminal activities,"" she said.

Grey believes Saqijuq can fit into the wider discussion of self-determination for Inuit.

""It pushes us to take things into our own hands and do things the way we see fit ... without having to depend on outside influences.""",,2024-11-14,

Police responded to a home on Hawk Ridge Road in Harrison after receiving a call from a man who said he was armed and planned to hurt himself, the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office said in a statement Wednesday night. Police say the man, identified as Arthur Lefebvre, 57, was ""uncooperative"" and fired several rounds at the officers when they arrived at the residence.

Officers learned that there were family members at risk inside the home, the sheriff's office said. After the deputies tried unsuccessfully to communicate with Lefebvre, he came outside, confronted the officers with his weapon, and three officers shot at and injured him.

Lefebvre sustained serious injuries and was taken to Maine Medical Center via Lifeflight. His injuries did not appear to be life-threatening, the sheriff's office said.

The officers will be placed on administrative leave, as is standard practice, while the Office of the Maine Attorney General investigates the use of deadly force. The office hasn't found a police shooting unjustified since at least 1990.

The identities of the involved deputies were not released Wednesday.

It happened after gunshots were reported in the area, and the sheriff's office said it believes the man had a no-contact order that prohibited him from being at the home.

Around 10:01 p.m., multiple residents in the area of Northeast Everett Street and and Northeast 23rd Avenue called 911 to report hearing gunshots. Emergency dispatch received more calls over the next 30 minutes. Camas police, Vancouver police, Washougal police and the Clark County Sheriff's Office all responded.

""I was sitting in my living room and next thing I heard a shot,"" neighbor Ashleigh Valenzuela told KGW. She, her husband and her four kids were all at home. ""My kids thought fireworks. I said, 'No, that's not fireworks' ... Probably five minutes later I heard a second one. Five minutes after that I heard a third one.""

Law enforcement deployed an ""unmanned aircraft system"" around 10:37 p.m. and found the man outside a home. They learned that the man was believed to have a no-contact order that restricted him from being at the home or having firearms, according to the Clark County Sheriff's Office.

""I know the husband, or ex-husband, was a little bit troubled,"" said Valenzuela.

At some point, the man went into a vehicle in the driveway of the home, and around 11:03 p.m., law enforcement used an armored vehicle to try to communicate with him. As this happened, a deputy shot the man, the Clark County Sheriff's Office said. No one else was injured.

The man was taken to a hospital. The Clark County Sheriff's Office has not released any information about his condition and have not identified him.

""It was a little bit chaotic,"" Valenzuela said. ""I've lived here for my whole life, and this isn't Camas.""

The deputy who shot the man has been placed on leave, which is standard protocol. The deputy has not been named.

Northeast Everett Street was closed between Northeast 22nd Avenue to Northeast 23rd Avenue for the investigation.

(AP) -- Opening statements are expected Friday in the trial of the man accused of killing a Georgia nursing student, in a case that helped fan the immigration debate during the last election cycle.

Jose Ibarra is charged with murder and other crimes in the February killing of Laken Hope Riley, whose body was found on the University of Georgia Campus. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial, meaning his case will be heard and decided by Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard.

Prosecutors are expected to try to prove that Ibarra hit the 22-year-old Augusta University College of Nursing student in the head, asphyxiated her and intended to sexually assault her. They have chosen not to seek the death penalty, but they said in a court filing that they intended to seek a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

The killing added fuel to the national debate over immigration when federal authorities said Ibarra, who is Venezuelan, illegally entered the U.S. in 2022 and was allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case.

Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump, blamed Democratic President Joe Biden's border policies for her death. As he spoke about border security during his State of the Union address just weeks after the killing, Biden mentioned Riley by name.

Riley's body was found on Feb. 22 near running trails after a friend told police she had not returned from a morning run. Police have said her killing appeared to be a random attack. Ibarra was arrested the next day and is being held in the Athens-Clarke County Jail without bond.

Ibarra is charged with one count of malice murder, three counts of felony murder and one count each of kidnapping, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, hindering an emergency telephone call, tampering with evidence and being a peeping Tom.

Prosecutors say that on the day of Riley's killing, Ibarra peered into the window of an apartment in a university housing building, which is the basis for the peeping Tom charge.

Ahead of the trial, defense attorneys unsuccessfully tried to have the proceedings moved out of Athens, a city of about 130,000 people in northeastern Georgia. They also wanted to have the peeping Tom charge handled separately and to exclude some evidence and expert testimony.",,2024-11-15,

MOST RECENT STORIES

Ibarra is charged with one count of malice murder, three counts of felony murder and one count each of kidnapping, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, hindering an emergency telephone call, tampering with evidence and being a peeping Tom.

Prosecutors say that on the day of Riley's killing, Ibarra peered into the window of an apartment in a university housing building, which is the basis for the peeping Tom charge.

The case has attracted national attention after it was discovered that Ibarra and his brothers, who are from Venezuela, were in the country illegally at the time of Laken Riley's murder.

During a bench trial, the judge both acts as the finder of fact and rules on matters of law and procedure. Some defendants and counsel believe that a judge will be less emotionally swayed by certain evidence than would a jury. However, a disadvantage is that the judge knows the law much better than a jury and less likely to ignore evidence.

A bench trial is also faster and less expensive than a jury trial.

""I've had this happen a few times, especially in criminal cases, where something is potentially politically charged,"" said Jessica Cino, an attorney and partner at Krevolin and Horst.

Cino, who has no affiliation with the case, said defendants can chose bench trials when they are concerned about finding an impartial jury.

""Somebody's life is on the line, in terms of, they could go to jail for the rest of it. You really want it to be decided on the evidence and not on emotion,"" she said. ""It also changes your opening argument. It changes some of the questions you might be asking witnesses, you know, depending on the jury or the objections that you're going to raise.""

Over the past several months, there have been numerous motions filed in this high-profile case.

In September, Ibarra's defense attorneys submitted a motion to suppress certain evidence collected after Riley's death. The defense argued that some evidence was obtained unlawfully. However, a judge ruled last week that evidence, including fingerprints found on Ibarra's phones, could be used in court, confirming that the search warrants were executed properly.

The judge also ruled that the cellphone seizure fell under the clause in the search warrant that ""[a]ny item or article that could be used in the commission of the crime."" He also wrote in his opinion that the date was not overly broad as September 2022 was when the FBI believes the brothers entered the United States illegally.

Last month, the judge denied a request by the defense to move the trial outside of Athens-Clarke County. The defense cited the extensive media coverage would make it difficult for Ibarra to receive a fair trial and that the jury pool might be inherently biased.

While the judge conceded this is a high-profile case, he added that news of the case has reached all across Georgia and even made national news. He said widespread pretrial publicity alone does not automatically justify a change of venue.",,2024-11-15,

Steven Williams, an officer with the Prescott Police Department, had been on administrative leave since last month when the allegations about his conduct at Woodbury High School came to light last month.

In a separation agreement between Williams, police union and the city set to go into effect Friday, Nov. 15, Williams will resign from the department rather than face termination. He'll get a payout of his vacation time and can keep his health insurance through the end of the month.

Williams' reenactment of Floyd's 2020 murder by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was just one of several ""inappropriate and racially harmful"" actions he took in the classroom on Oct. 14, according to officials with South Washington County Schools.

That means bringing back gang-related sentencing enhancements, allowing prosecutors to file juvenile charges more freely, and having prosecutors attend parole hearings with victims' families again, where they can help argue against the release of convicts, Hochman said.

The former Republican-turned-independent also plans to return to prosecuting low-level nonviolent crimes that he said the current district attorney has not, such as criminal threats, trespassing, disturbing the peace and loitering, which often involve those experiencing homelessness.

Anyone who breaks the law will receive ""proportional"" consequences -- no more ""get out of jail free"" cards, Hochman said in the interview Wednesday.

At the same time, he wants to look at solutions that don't necessarily involve locking criminals up, such as court-mandated drug treatment, community service, and restitution.

""There's a culture of lawlessness"" that has been ""perpetrated"" by Gascón's office, Hochman said.

""We're going to reverse that,"" he said. ""You basically say, 'Here are the lines in our society, the lines are the laws, I'm going to consistently, fairly and impartially enforce them and here the real consequences on the other side. So if you want to, test me. If you think I'm bluffing, I'm not bluffing.'""

Hochman says he doesn't want to simply fill up prisons again.

""This is my message to people who believe in criminal justice reform: I believe in it as well,"" Hochman said. ""The difference between myself and my predecessor is it won't be a bunch of talk.""

Hochman's victory Nov. 5 to become top prosecutor in the nation's most populous county of 10 million people reflected growing discontent in California with progressive district attorneys who have pushed criminal justice reform.

Gascón, a former San Francisco police chief, was elected in 2020 during the height of the Black Lives Matter movement following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota as part of a wave of progressive prosecutors elected nationwide.

He brought several controversial changes to the district attorney's office that were seen by critics as soft on crime, such as ending cash bail and not allowing prosecutors to charge juveniles as adults or ask for sentencing enhancements. He also recently addressed the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, saying he would seek resentencing for the brothers who received life sentences for the shotgun killings of their parents in their Beverly Hills home in 1989. Hochman, who could influence the Menendez case, said he could not comment on the resentencing recommendation until he has time to review confidential documents related to the brothers.

Gascón defended his work, saying in his concession statement: ""I'm deeply proud of what we've accomplished over the past four years and grateful to the communities who have been and will always be the heart of criminal justice reform.""

In 2014, Gascón, then district attorney in San Francisco, co-authored a ballot measure passed by California voters that reclassified certain low-level drug and property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. The measure was approved as California spent years struggling with a 2009 federal court order to reduce the population in the state's overcrowded prisons.

But increased property crime in LA County, emphasized by viral videos of smash-and-grab retail theft, as well as a worsening drug epidemic and increasing homelessness have fed a feeling of lawlessness and frustration that voters brought to the polls last week.

Prosecutors across the state are now armed with the passage this month of Proposition 36, a ballot measure that gives them the ability to charge shoplifting and drug possession crimes as felonies after a third offense.

Hochman declined to say whether his office plans to review current misdemeanor cases to elevate them to felonies but said the ultimate goal is deterrence. His goal is to return to a year like 2014, which he said was considered the region's safest year in the last 50 years.

""I don't predict that you're going to have thousands of people now going to prison,"" he said. ""The goal is ultimately to deter them from committing the crimes in the first place. That's when I'll know that I'm actually doing something that is effective in the criminal justice system, not by filling prisons to the breaking point. That's a failure of the system.""

With a little over two weeks before being sworn into office and taking over a department of more than 700 prosecutors, Hochman spent a recent morning this week in Hermosa Beach, a city south of Los Angeles, observing ""homeless court.""

The program, which began in the coastal city of Redondo Beach, gives people experiencing homelessness the opportunity to avoid prosecution for nonviolent misdemeanor charges or municipal code violations in exchange for accepting judge-mandated services that can eventually lead to placement in housing.

""I thought it was a really innovative way to try and deal with low-level homeless crime ... and get the homeless individuals the help that they need to ensure that they actually won't ever have to be back in court,"" Hochman said.",,2024-11-15,

Charles Q. Brown Jr. during his confirmation hearing in 2023 to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Since becoming America's top military officer last year, Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. has hewed to a cautious tack: keeping his views largely to himself, publicly deferring to elected leaders on pressing security questions, and attempting to steer clear of the polarized politics consuming the nation at large.

But Brown was thrust into the heart of a brewing storm Tuesday when President-elect Donald Trump nominated Pete Hegseth, an Army veteran and Fox News host, to become defense secretary, days after Hegseth suggested firing Brown and other senior officers over what he described as a ""woke"" agenda undermining U.S. military strength. As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Brown serves as chief military adviser to both the president and the Pentagon chief.

Trump's selection of Hegseth -- who rose to prominence among Trump-aligned conservatives decrying the dangers of Pentagon ""wokeism"" and advocating defiance of long-standing military norms -- sharply intensifies the challenges facing Brown in the wake of Trump's Nov. 5 victory, as the general must navigate a highly charged presidential transition and shepherd 1.3 million active-duty troops into a new era while staring down a possible dismissal by his incoming boss.

The potential for a high-profile confrontation between the Pentagon's two most senior leaders -- one a telegenic political appointee, the other a circumspect career soldier -- further challenges the military's fraying status as a trusted, apolitical American institution. Polls show that public confidence in the military, intended to act as a national ballast amid shifting political currents, has fallen to its lowest level in decades.

Kori Schake, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, cautioned that injecting politics into the management of military issues -- even for those who agree with the reasons for doing so -- would accelerate that erosion of trust.

""The best course for him is to continue doing what he thinks serves the best interests of the country, whether that keeps him in his job or gets him fired,"" Schake said of the general.

Brown, who declined to comment for this article, has not spoken publicly about the comments by Trump or Hegseth.

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A former F-16 pilot, Brown ascended to the top military job in September 2023 with an extensive leadership record, having served as deputy head of U.S. Central Command and chief of U.S. air forces in the Middle East as the military conducted a massive air campaign against the Islamic State. He then commanded air forces in the Pacific before being tapped by Trump as Air Force chief of staff in 2020.

During Brown's swearing-in ceremony in the Oval Office that year, Trump praised the general, calling him ""a great gentleman, a great man.""

Following a 2017 decision by Congress to extend the chairman's term from two to four years, an attempt to ensure security continuity across administrations, Brown is expected to remain in office until 2027. As a candidate to return to the White House, however, Trump drew a distinction between fighting and ""woke"" generals, vowing to clear out the latter.

A self-labeled introvert, Brown is described by associates as studious and reserved, often last to speak in a group but concise and direct when he does. Unlike his predecessor, the voluble Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, who was known to regale others with historical lessons and personal stories for hours at a time, Brown typically shares little.

A stickler for schedule and process, he gained wider notice during a moment of national reckoning over race when, following the police killing of George Floyd, he spoke in raw, emotional terms about his experience as a Black man in the U.S. military. While both Brown and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are African American, the military's upper ranks have historically been dominated by White men. Brown served as the country's first African American Air Force chief and is only the second Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

During his confirmation hearing in 2023, Brown faced pressure over the military's attempts to diversify its ranks and elevate minority personnel, which critics say has undercut military effectiveness and fueled a major recruitment crisis. That included questioning over a 2022 Air Force memo outlining goals for broadening the racial, ethnic and gender composition of Air Force and Space Force candidates.

But Brown has sought to push back on the notion that he supports lowering standards, instead underscoring his backing for merit-based advancement and highlighting his own drive to excel across any demographic group.

""When I put my helmet on and put that visor down and get in that F-16, you don't know who I am. You don't really care. You just want to make sure I'm getting the job done,"" Brown said this fall. ""And that's what we believe about bringing people into our service.""

The Biden administration has described critics' emphasis on military efforts to foster diversity as distorted and dishonest. Army leaders have noted that recruits receive just one hour of equal-opportunity instruction during basic training, compared with 92 hours of rifle marksmanship instruction.

In the months leading up to this moment, Brown's cautious style has mirrored that embraced by retired Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. ahead of the 2016 election, when the then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs rigorously avoided comment on issues being debated by Hillary Clinton and Trump, then a norm-busting newcomer, even when they fell squarely in the military sphere, like the relevance of the NATO alliance. After Trump defeated Clinton, that discipline well served Dunford, who went on to advise the president until the general's retirement in 2019.

Any chairman preparing to serve a new president must try to maintain distance from politics and ensure they will be viewed as representing the uniformed ranks, rather than the outgoing leader, according to a former military official who advised a previous chairman's presidential transition.

""He's got to be able to go into that room and be seen as a credible voice for the military,"" the former official said, speaking like some others on the condition of anonymity to discuss this transition. ""And if he's not, he can't do his job effectively.""

As a senior adviser to the second Trump administration, Brown and his subordinates will have to adapt to their new political leaders' priorities and goals. The new administration is expected to shift course on the war in Ukraine, voice more categorical support for Israel in its battles against Iranian-linked militants, and potentially take a harder line against Tehran itself.

They will also have to adjust to the incoming administration's style. During Trump's previous term, military leaders were often caught off guard by unexpected policy pronouncements made on social media or statements by the president challenging long-held security norms. Eventually officers learned to disregard Twitter pronouncements until they resulted in written orders.

Trump's previous chairmen, Dunford and Milley, learned to navigate the president's unpredictable communication style and his seeming interest in dominating the public discourse in Washington. Sometimes that meant waiting to make public pronouncements while traveling overseas rather than doing so in Washington.

""If we were in D.C., the president was the official voice,"" the former military official said. ""We understood that his voice must be the most prominent when discussing military matters.""",,2024-11-14,

A Florida mother set up her own sting operation at a Popeyes fast food restaurant to confront a man who was allegedly sexting her 13-year-old daughter. The face-off ended with the suspect being shot multiple times.

Jacksonville Sheriff's Chief of Investigations Alan Parker said during a press conference Monday that 18-year-old Cerry Rodriques Banks ""was having an inappropriate text relationship with a 13-year-old female.""

'As the officer reaches the corner of the business, he observes the suspect pull the pistol from his waistband.'

The girl's mother allegedly became aware of the illicit communications. She then took her daughter's phone and texted with the suspect, pretending to be her underage daughter.

The mother then set up a meeting with the 18-year-old man around 7 a.m. Sunday at a Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen restaurant in Jacksonville.

Banks arrived at the fast food restaurant, believing he was meeting with the girl -- but instead, he was met by the mother as well as her daughter and 11-year-old son.

The suspect brandished a gun and reportedly told the mother, ""When you hear the shots tonight, you know what's up.""

The unnamed mother rushed her children into the Popeyes, and the suspect allegedly walked to the rear of the fast food restaurant -- and the mom contacted authorities.

Police said the suspect had ample time to vacate the area, but he stayed outside of the restaurant.

Police officers confronted Banks and gave the suspect ""multiple verbal commands"" to ""turn around and show his hands.""

The suspect disregarded the commands, however, and fled.

Parker of the sheriff's office stated, ""As the officer reaches the corner of the business, he observes the suspect pull the pistol from his waistband.""

The officer reportedly instructed Banks to drop his weapon, which the suspect refused to do.

With that, the officer -- a 7-year veteran -- shot the suspect multiple times.

""The suspect continues to flee and, near a neighboring business, drops the gun,"" Parker said.

Banks was able to get away from the pursuing officer, but other officers set up a perimeter.

With assistance from a K-9 unit, the suspect was apprehended in a drainage tunnel without further incident.

Parker said the suspect was shot in his hand, torso, and possibly ""in the leg."" He received medical assistance at the scene before being transported to a local hospital to treat his wounds.

Police said they recovered the gun, and the weapon did not appear to have been discharged during the incident.

According to jail records from the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, Banks was charged with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill, two counts of lewd and lascivious conduct by an offender 18 or older with the victim less than 16, unlawful use of a two-way communication device, and travel to meet after using a computer to seduce/solicit/lure a child.

Bond was set at $700,018.

Jacksonville Sheriff T.K. Waters said he understood the mother's concern but that parents should allow law enforcement to handle situations such as this.

""We'd absolutely love to handle every situation, but this is a mother who's concerned about her daughter. So, I get it, I understand,"" Waters said during the press conference. ""But, I would say that in most cases, in situations like that, call us and let us come out and deal with the situation, so it doesn't unfold like this.""",,2024-11-14,

With three dead, including the shooting suspect, and a Harbor Police officer hospitalized with a gunshot wound, San Diego's homicide unit provided details of the department's criminal investigation of the broad-daylight killings.

SDPD Lt. Jud Campbell spoke to the media at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday near the intersection of Juniper Street and Kettner Boulevard, where a 26-year-old man was killed when two Harbor Police officers returned fire after their colleague, who did not discharge his weapon, was hit by a bullet in the thigh.

Campbell said the two victims, a 39-year-old man and a woman, 31, were inside a car when they were shot at around 8:22 a.m. Arriving officers pulled them both out of the vehicle but were unable to save them with CPR.

With it being so early in the investigation, there were many details Campbell declined to divulge.

However, ""I will say this: This was not a random attack. We do believe this was targeted,"" Campbell said.

A colleague of Campbell's, homicide Capt. Manuel del Toro, also spoke about the relationships of the victims and their killer.

""We think that the three knew each other and that there was also a motive for this,"" del Toro said in Spanish. ""He shot many times there with a lot of hatred and aimed at the two of them, so we think there is a connection. That is what we are investigating.""

The gunman who targeted them, the officer said, was wearing a hat, green shirt and blue jeans, a description sent out to all the units in the area and a police helicopter, which quickly began broadcasting the suspect's description.

""Obviously, when two people are shot in daylight like this, we want to get that out to as many people as possible,"" Campbell said.

Two Harbor Police were in the area, at Juniper and Kettner, Campbell said, when a citizen flagged them down around 9:06 a.m.

""Essentially what he described was: He had seen a male duck behind an electrical box,"" Campbell said. ""That drew his attention to the male. He listened to the announcement from [police helicopter] ABLE ... and realized this is probably the person who police are looking for.""

Four Harbor Police officers moved into the area and quickly began issuing commands to the man hidden behind the electrical box.

""As they were doing that, it appears the suspect began firing at them, multiple rounds,"" Campbell said. ""Two of the officers returned fire, striking the suspect, and, as you know, one of the Harbor Police officers was struck in the thigh area.""

The suspect, who was shot multiple times, was taken to the hospital, where he subsequently died of his injuries.

Campbell said a firearm, which appears to be a semi-automatic handgun, was found at the scene, as were discharged shell casings. The lieutenant also said investigators have taken statements from the dozens of witnesses who were in the area, and are also gathering video surveillance. Two separate homicide teams, one at each shooting scene, are conducting the investigation.

""Our goal is to know what happened and why,"" Campbell said.

SDPD believes that everybody involved has been positively identified and that they are all San Diegans.

San Diego Police are investigating a deadly shooting in broad daylight Wednesday in San Diego's Little Italy neighborhood that was followed by a shootout involving police a short while later.

Officers were called to Ash and Union streets around 8:20 a.m. Police at first confirmed that one person had died, and, later, said a second victim was killed as well.

Don Stevenson told NBC 7 that he witnessed the incident near Ash Street.

""I was pulling up to a job site,"" Stevenson said, ""a guy walked up to a car and shot and killed two people and took off running.""

About 45 minutes into the investigation of that shooting, San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl said at a news conference held around 10 a.m., officers from the San Diego Harbor Police who were in the area assisting in the suspect search located him about a mile away, in the 2200 block of Kettner Boulevard, close to Juniper Street. The suspect fired at the police, Wahl said, and shot an officer in the hip.

""We believe he's going to be OK, but his status is unknown,"" Wahl said.

The second shooting took place not far from the popular Crack Shack restaurant. An employee of the eatery said they heard the shots and dived to the ground for their safety, remaining there for about 40 minutes. A worker also showed NBC 7 photos of their car, hit by gunfire.

Police then returned fire and struck the suspect, who has also been taken to the hospital. The department's homicide captain told NBC 7 later in the morning that the suspect had also died.

""The motive and the reason behind this shooting is completely unknown at this point,"" Wahl said, adding that he had no information yet on the suspect's identity.

Due to an ongoing police investigation, please avoid the following areas due to road closures for the next several hours:

""I want to put out to the public that there is no further threat to the community,"" Wahl said, ""that we have everybody that was involved in this initial shooting incident.""

Wahl began the news conference by saying that the situation could have been much worse.

""This is Little Italy,"" Wahl said. ""We have people walking the streets, coffee shops.""

Police are urging residents to avoid the area of both shootings while the investigation is still active.

The officer who was shot was taken to the UC San Diego Medical Center in Hillcrest for treatment.

Around 1 p.m., Harbor Police Chief Magda Fernandez provided an update on the condition of the officer.

""I did speak to him before he went into surgery,"" said Fernandez, who declined to identify the lawman at this time. ""He was awake, he was alert and he was in good spirits.""

The officer, who has only been with the Harbor Police for three months and is currently in field training, is now recovering after surgery, which was completed around noon.

""I will tell you that the actions of all officers on scene saved lives today,"" Fernandez said, saying that Wednesday's incident was a prime example of the dangers the police face every day.",,2024-11-14,

Inside a residence, police said, officers found two people in an altercation, one of whom was armed with a knife. Officers gave commands to drop the knife and Officer Alexander Bookman shot one of the people, Metro said.

The man who died was identified by the coroner's office Thursday as Brandon Durham, a 43-year-old. His cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds.

INDIANAPOLIS -- The widow of a man who was killed in a police chase crash is suing IMPD and the city of Indianapolis.

James Collins, 83, was riding in an Uber on April 25, 2024. The car he was riding in was hit by a driver who was fleeing from IMPD at the intersection of 49th Street and Carvel Avenue, near North College Avenue on the city's north side.

Collins was taken to the hospital in critical condition. He died on June 15.

In the lawsuit, lawyers for Collins' widow call the deadly crash a ""predictable outcome"" because the high speed chase went through a ""densely populated area.""

According to the lawsuit, IMPD was negligent in the following ways:

Collins' widow is asking for a trial to award damages and court fees.

Kevianna Vinson, of Indianapolis, the driver of the Jeep that hit Collins' Uber, is charged with seven felony counts, including resisting law enforcement, leaving the scene of a serious accident and reckless homicide. Her trial is scheduled for Dec. 3, 2024.

According to Collins' obituary, he was Chair of the Psychology Department at the University of Missouri-Kansas City for many years. He retired in 2003 but stayed active in Habitat for Humanity. He moved to Indiana to be closer to his daughter and four grandchildren.",,2024-11-14,
