Officers showed up at the home and found a man struggling with a woman over a knife. An officer opened fire and struck the man, killing him at the scene. Only later did they discover the man who was killed lived at the home and was struggling to fend off the woman who had broken into his home.

The man and woman knew each other and had been in a relationship, police say.

The incident happened Tuesday around 12:40 a.m.

Police say Brandon Durham, 43, had called 911 and reported multiple people outside his home shooting, then told the 911 operator that someone had entered his home through the front and back doors and he was locking himself in the bathroom.

He also told the 911 operator that he was home with his 15-year-old daughter, according to police. Officers kicked open the door after arriving on scene and hearing someone screaming as well as damage to vehicles parked outside the property, police said.

Inside the home, police say, officers found Durham and the suspect, identified as Alejandra Boudreaux, struggling over a knife and an officer-involved shooting occurred.

Boudreaux was not hit by gunfire. She was booked for home invasion with a deadly weapon, assault with a deadly weapon child abuse and domestic violence.

The officer who fired is 26 years old and has been with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department since 2021. An investigation is underway to determine if the officer acted appropriately when he fired his weapon.",https://abc7.com/post/las-vegas-police-kill-victim-of-home-invasion-who-called-911-for-help/15549861/,ABC7,eng,2024-11-16,05:57:36,

Around 9:19 a.m., two officers pulled over Albert Jose Rodriguez Jr., 48, of San Bernardino, for what police said were ""multiple vehicle code violations.""

According to the Friday media release, Rodriguez was uncooperative during the stop, refusing to get out of the vehicle. He also refused orders to stop reaching inside his shirt, where a firearm was later located.

Police said officers then attempted to remove Rodriguez from the vehicle, and a struggle ensued, during which the suspect attempted to drive away.

During this flee attempt, the officer positioned on the vehicle's passenger side reportedly leaned into the car to turn it off and unbuckle Rodriguez's seat belt.

However, ""Rodriguez continued to violently resist and managed to drive away, injuring one officer and trapping the other in the vehicle,"" wrote the department.

Then, as he was driving with the trapped officer, Rodriguez attempted to grab the loaded firearm from inside his shirt.

Police said this is when the officer-involved shooting occurred.

""After the shooting, the officer had to take control of the still-moving vehicle and steer it to safety to prevent it from colliding with other motorists on the roadway,"" stated the release. ""Following the incident, officers recovered the firearm that Rodriguez was armed with and began administering lifesaving measures while paramedics were called to the scene.""

First responders transported Rodriguez to a local hospital where he was later pronounced deceased.

Officers later searched the vehicle and located ""an amount of suspected narcotics."" Police did not immediately provide a specific quantity.

The release stated ""Rodriguez was a documented gang member with an extensive criminal history, which included arrests for assault with a deadly weapon, sales of narcotics, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.""

Officers initially responded to 92nd Street and South Central Avenue around 9 p.m. on Friday night for reports of a robbery.

Before their arrival, LAPD's investigation later revealed that the suspect, identified as Nija Hill, pistol-whipped two victims in an alley adjacent to a laundromat, located near the 9200 block of South Central Avenue.

Hill, still armed, went into the laundromat to threaten several people inside and then came back outside to again threaten several vendors with his gun. The reports did not specify whether he successfully robbed the victims.

Officers then responded and found Hill standing on the sidewalk outside of the laundromat, but the suspect took off on foot when he noticed law enforcement's arrival.

LAPD said it was not very long into the chase that Hill pulled out his gun and fired at the pursuing officers, resulting in the Officer-Involved Shooting (OIS), near the 9200 block of South Central Avenue.

Both officers were struck by Hill's gunfire, and the robbery suspect escaped.

It was at this time that a Help Call was broadcast and officers came to set up a perimeter in the area.

Sky5 was overhead at 10 p.m. and reported seeing ambulances called for two officers.

LAPD said one officer was transported for a possible gunshot wound somewhere on the right side of their body. The second officer was transported for a possible gunshot wound or graze wound to the hand.

KTLA's Gil Leyvas reported seeing the officer with the hand wound taken out on his own power, and the other officer was taken out on a gurney - but both officers were conscious and speaking to paramedics.

In the meantime, LAPD said Hill fled to the area of 93rd Street and Clovis Avenue where he attempted to carjack an additional victim.

However, this carjack attempt was unsuccessful, and police said Hill hid within the perimeter.

A SWAT team then arrived at the scene to help search and found Hill in the area of 92nd Street and Wadsworth Avenue, where LAPD says he was taken into custody without incident.

""It was observed during his detention that Hill had sustained a gunshot wound to his right leg during the OIS,"" LAPD reported.

Hill was then taken to a local hospital where he was treated and cleared for booking. Police did not provide Hill's age or residence location.

LAPD also provided an update on Saturday that both officers were treated for their wounds and subsequently discharged.

Additionally, a victim of one of Hill's earlier assaults was transported to a local hospital where he was treated and discharged for his injuries.

Detectives later found a Glock Model 17, 9mm, semi-automatic firearm and empty magazine in a trash receptacle in the area of 93rd Street and Clovis Avenue, and nine discharged 9mm cartridges located within the OIS crime scene.

LAPD said the pistol, magazine and cartridge casings were processed and booked into evidence.

deputy involved shooting,8404106491,"Bodycam video shows deputies shooting man who shot into car carrying child, woman in Castaic","CASTAIC, Calif. (KABC) -- The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department released body camera footage Friday of a deputy-involved shooting in Castaic that stemmed from a domestic violence incident.

The shooting occurred on October 11 around 12:05 p.m. in the area of the 28000 block of Sloan Canyon Road, less than a mile west of the 5 Freeway.

Warning: The video above is graphic and may be disturbing to some readers.

Deputies with the Santa Clarita Sheriff's Station responded to the area after receiving a 911 call about a domestic disturbance. The caller said he heard a man and a woman arguing inside a car.

The audio from that call was also released Friday and at least two gunshots were heard in the distance.

""Yeah, we've got a domestic dispute going on over here off Parker Road in Castaic, just before you get to Sloan Canyon Driver ..."" the caller said.

At that moment, the caller is interrupted by a gunshot.

""Oh ... somebody just shot a 38, I think. Somebody needs to get over here ASAP.""

When responding deputies arrived, the sheriff's department said 48-year-old Raul Martinez and the woman were standing near the car behind the open driver's side door.

The two appeared to have been involved in a physical altercation, investigators said. The relationship between the two was not disclosed.

According to the sheriff's department, when a deputy got out of his patrol vehicle, Martinez pulled out a handgun and pointed it at the deputy. Bodycam footage shows the deputy drawing his gun and pointing it at Martinez.

Martinez was shot and apparently passed out, according to the video. He was rushed to the hospital where he was treated for non-life threatening injuries.

In the video, you can see a handgun at the woman's feet and a young child in the car right behind the woman. That child was later identified as Martinez's child.

Another portion of the video shows Martinez holding onto the victim with a gun in his hand. The child was not injured.

Investigators later learned that Martinez had fired a gun twice during the altercation, one of the rounds going into the car with his child inside. Martinez has since been charged with assault with a firearm, false imprisonment, child endangerment and other weapon offenses.

The sheriff's department said a loaded semi-automatic 9MM handgun and a loaded .22 caliber revolver were recovered from the scene.

police killing,8415121145,Trump transition team compiling list of current and former U.S. military officers for possible courts-martial,"The Trump transition team is compiling a list of senior current and former U.S. military officers who were directly involved in the withdrawal from Afghanistan and exploring whether they could be court-martialed for their involvement, a U.S. official and a person familiar with the plan told NBC News.

Officials working on the transition are considering creating a commission to investigate the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, including gathering information about who was directly involved in the decision-making for the military, how it was carried out, and whether the military leaders could be eligible for charges as serious as treason, the U.S. official and person with knowledge of the plan said.

""They're taking it very seriously,"" the person with knowledge of the plan said.

The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Matt Flynn, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for counternarcotics and global threats, is helping lead the effort, the sources said. It is being framed as a review of how the U.S. first got into the war in Afghanistan and how the U.S. ultimately withdrew.

President-elect Donald Trump has condemned the withdrawal as a ""humiliation"" and ""the most embarrassing day in the history of our country.""

It is not clear, though, what would legally justify ""treason"" charges since the military officers were following the orders of President Joe Biden to withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan.

A 2022 independent review by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction blamed both the Trump and Biden administrations for the chaotic U.S. withdrawal in 2021.

Trump first reached an agreement with the Taliban in 2020 to withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan, roughly 13,000 troops, and release 5,000 Taliban fighters from prison. The Biden administration then completed the withdrawal and badly overestimated the ability of Afghan government forces to fight the Taliban on their own.

Trump's choice for secretary of defense, Fox News personality Pete Hegseth, has criticized the withdrawal, saying the U.S. lost the war and wasted billions of dollars.

In his book ""The War on Warriors,"" Hegseth wrote, ""The next president of the United States needs to radically overhaul Pentagon senior leadership to make us ready to defend our nation and defeat our enemies. Lots of people need to be fired. The debacle in Afghanistan, of course, is the most glaring example.""

Hegseth calls the withdrawal a ""humiliating retreat"" and says leaders at the Pentagon were not held accountable for the deadly attack at Abbey Gate, which killed 13 U.S. service members and roughly 170 Afghan civilians. Nor were they held accountable for a subsequent U.S. airstrike in Kabul that officials thought would kill the Islamic State group leader behind the suicide attack but instead killed 10 innocent Afghans, including seven children, he wrote.

""These generals lied. They mismanaged. They violated their oath. They failed. They disgraced our troops, and our nation. They got people killed, unnecessarily,"" he wrote. ""And, to this moment, they keep their jobs. Worse, they continue to actively erode our military and its values -- by capitulating to civilians with radical agendas. They are an embarrassment, with stars still on their shoulders.""

The transition team is looking at the possibility of recalling several commanders to active duty for possible charges, the U.S. official said.

It's not clear the Trump administration would pursue treason charges, and instead could focus on lesser charges that highlight the officer's involvement. ""They want to set an example,"" said the person with knowledge of the plan.

Speaking to NBC News days before the election, Howard Lutnick, one of the two advisers leading the transition, said Trump learned after his first administration that he had hired Democratic generals, and he would not make that mistake again.

Former officials who worked in Trump's first administration have said they advised Trump against policies they thought would weaken U.S. national security, such as withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria. And they advised against actions that they thought might violate the Constitution or inflame tensions domestically, such as deploying active-duty U.S. troops to quell protests after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd.",https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/trump-transition-team-compiling-list-of-current-and-former-u-s-military-officers-for-possible-courts-martial/3562642/,NBC Southern California,eng,2024-11-17,03:26:13,
police killing,8413475489,Trial begins for the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley,"A Venezuelan man ""went hunting for females on the University of Georgia's campus"" earlier this year and ended up killing nursing student Laken Riley after a struggle, a prosecutor said Friday. A defense attorney said the evidence is circumstantial and doesn't prove his client is guilty.

Jose Ibarra, who entered the U.S. illegally two years ago, is charged with murder and other crimes in Riley's February killing, which helped fan the immigration debate during this year's presidential campaign. Ibarra waived his right to a jury trial, meaning his case is being will be heard and decided by Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard.

Prosecutor Sheila Ross told the judge that Ibarra encountered Riley, a 22-year-old student at Augusta University College of Nursing, while she was out running on Feb. 22.

""When Laken Riley refused to be his rape victim, he bashed her skull in with a rock repeatedly,"" Ross said, adding that the evidence will show that Riley ""fought for her life, for her dignity.""

As a result of that fight, Ibarra's DNA was left under her fingernails, Ross said. Riley called 911 and, in a struggle over her phone, Ibarra's thumbprint was left on the screen, she said.

The forensic evidence is sufficient to prove Ibarra's guilt, but digital and video evidence will also show that Ibarra killed Riley, the prosecutor said.

Defense attorney Dustin Kirby called the evidence in the case graphic and disturbing, but he said none of it proves that his client killed Riley.

""The evidence in this case is very good that Laken Riley was murdered,"" he said. ""The evidence that Jose Ibarra killed Laken Riley is circumstantial. The evidence that anyone had any intent or certainly committed any sexual assault is speculation.""

The killing added fuel to the national debate over immigration when federal authorities said Ibarra illegally entered the U.S. in 2022 and was allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case.

Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump, blamed Democratic President Joe Biden's border policies for her death. As he spoke about border security during his State of the Union address weeks after the killing, Biden mentioned Riley by name.

Riley's body was found near running trails after her roommates told police she had not returned from a morning run. Police said her killing appeared to be a random attack. Ibarra was arrested the next day and has been held in the Athens-Clarke County Jail without bond.

Ibarra is charged with one count of malice murder, three counts of felony murder and one count each of kidnapping, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, hindering an emergency telephone call, tampering with evidence and being a peeping Tom.

Prosecutors say that on the day of Riley's killing, Ibarra peered into the window of an apartment in a university housing building, which is the basis for the peeping Tom charge.

Before the trial, defense attorneys unsuccessfully tried to have the proceedings moved out of Athens, a city of about 130,000 people about 70 miles east of Atlanta. They also wanted to have the peeping Tom charge handled separately and to exclude some evidence and expert testimony.",https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/jose-ibarra-murder-trial-laken-riley-georgia-nursing-student/3561972/,NBC Southern California,eng,2024-11-15,18:23:14,
police killing,8398643617,LA County DA's race: Nathan Hochman appears headed to victory with commanding lead over Gascón,"LOS ANGELES -- Former federal prosecutor Nathan Hochman appears to be heading to victory in his bid to unseat incumbent Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón.

A tally of ballots early Wednesday morning showed Hochman with a commanding lead with roughly 61% of the vote, while Gascón has 39%.

Eyewitness News will interview Hochman during a special post-election newscast. Tune in at 8 a.m. on our 24/7 streaming channel.

""It's a big job, but I am absolutely energized by the fact that I've got over 750 prosecutors who are ready to get to work,"" Hochman told Eyewitness News Tuesday night. ""I've got tens of thousands of law enforcement officers who will no longer say 'my hands are tied.'""

Gascón won election as Los Angeles County district attorney in 2020 on promises to implement criminal justice reform in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Four years later he faces a tough-on-crime challenger who says such policies have gone too far.

Hochman, a former federal prosecutor, calls himself a ""hard middle"" candidate who would reject both mass incarceration and ""decarceration"" policies and the ""public safety failure"" of Gascón's tenure the past four years.

He advanced out of a primary field of 11 challengers and spent most of the campaign attacking Gascón policies that he says led to increased crime and a lack of consequences for juvenile offenders. During debates he spotlighted rising violent crime in the county, a trend also seen statewide and at the national level.

""The voters of Los Angeles County have spoken and have said enough is enough of D.A. Gascón's pro-criminal extreme policies; they look forward to a safer future,"" Hochman said in a statement early Wednesday. ""As D.A., I look forward to representing all of the people, whether they voted for me or not, since their safety will be my responsibility.""

Hochman's projected victory reflects growing discontent in the state with progressive district attorneys who have pushed criminal justice reform. Previously there were two attempts to recall Gascón that failed to qualify for the ballot.

When Gascón first ran for office, he vowed he would not seek the death penalty in prosecutions, charge juveniles as adults or ask for sentencing enhancements that can drastically lengthen prison time. Endorsed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, then-Mayor Eric Garcetti and other prominent officials, he unseated incumbent District Attorney Jackie Lacey.

""We have had about 30 some years to get where we are today. It would be unrealistic for me or anyone to expect that in four years, we're going to turn everything around,"" Gascón said Wednesday night. ""Including when you consider that in those four years we had two and a half years of a pandemic, which brought so many things to a halt. Definitely, in order for this work to be able to continue to develop, we would need more time.""

Gascón co-authored a ballot measure passed by California voters in 2014 that reclassified certain low-level drug and property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. Also Tuesday, voters approved a measure to partly roll back that law, making shoplifting a felony for repeat offenders again and increasing penalties for some drug charges.

Despite Gascón being a former Los Angeles police officer, Hochman had the support of local police unions.

He was also endorsed by victims' advocacy groups; former district attorney Jackie Lacey, whom Gascón defeated in 2020; developer and former mayoral candidate Rick Caruso; and more than 70 current and former county elected officials. Hochman raised nearly $4 million for the campaign.

A Southern California native, Hochman emphasized his past prosecutorial experience as assistant U.S. attorney in California's Central District. He has also practiced as a private defense attorney.

He previously ran unsuccessfully for California attorney general as a Republican, but was an independent in this race and describes himself as a lifelong centrist.",https://abc7.com/post/los-angeles-county-district-attorney-race-voters-decide-between-george-gascon-nathan-hochman/15516975/,ABC7,eng,2024-11-06,12:48:01,
police killing,8397114079,LA County voters to decide between Gascón or tough-on-crime challenger in DA race,"LOS ANGELES -- George Gascón won election as Los Angeles County district attorney in 2020 on promises to implement criminal justice reform in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Four years later he faces a tough-on-crime challenger who says such policies have gone too far.

Nathan Hochman, a former federal prosecutor, calls himself a ""hard middle"" candidate who would reject both mass incarceration and ""decarceration"" policies. Despite being a former Republican running as an independent in a heavily Democratic city, he has raised more than $4 million compared with Gascon's less than $1 million, not including contributions to outside groups supporting the candidates.

When Gascón first ran for office, he vowed he would not seek the death penalty in prosecutions, charge juveniles as adults or ask for sentencing enhancements that can drastically lengthen prison time. Endorsed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, then-Mayor Eric Garcetti and other prominent officials, he unseated incumbent District Attorney Jackie Lacey.

Gascón ran into trouble trying to enact those reforms, however, including opposition from some of his own staff - and even some lawsuits accusing him of workplace retaliation for challenging his directives. Two attempts were made to recall him, but neither got enough signatures to make the ballot. He has since reversed course on several of those directives.

Hochman's candidacy reflects growing disillusionment in the state with progressive district attorneys who have pushed criminal justice reform. In 2022, San Francisco voters ousted one of the first reform-minded prosecutors elected to office, this year voters will decide whether to recall another in Oakland.

California Department of Justice crime statistics for L.A. County tell a mixed story.

Homicides are down by 23.1% since a small spike in 2021. Overall violent crime increased by 8.5.% between 2019 and 2023, but that was lower than a 15.4% rise statewide as part of a national trend since the COVID-19 pandemic. Property crime, however, is up 14.5% in L.A. County but just 2.9% at the state level.

Amid media coverage of high-profile killings and alarming viral videos of smash-and-grab mass retail robberies, victims' advocates and business interests are backing Hochman.

""Mr. Gascón has been one of the greatest gifts for gangs,"" Hochman said at a recent debate, lambasting him for not pursuing a gang sentencing enhancement in the killing of ""General Hospital"" actor Johnny Wactor.

Gascón has spent much of the campaign defending his policies and prosecution outcomes. On gang enhancements, for example, he said they have traditionally been tinged with racial bias and he formed a committee to decide them case by case. His office says it prosecuted over 100,000 ""serious crimes"" in the last four years, a rate comparable to the previous decade.

Hochman has also criticized Gascón's policy against prosecuting juveniles as adults and pointed to cases of recidivism.

They include a man who at age 16 took part in a 2018 gas station robbery and was later released from a youth detention facility, only to be arrested and charged this April in connection with a homicide. Another, a 17-year-old gang member in 2019 who admitted to a double homicide and could have faced life, was released last February and arrested months later in connection with a new killing.

Lots of attention was also paid to the case of Hannah Tubbs, a transgender woman who at age 26 was allowed to plead guilty in juvenile court for the sexual assault of a 10-year-old girl because the crime occurred when Tubbs was a minor. Tubbs later pleaded no contest to the killing of a homeless man in central California.

Gascón says he is handling juvenile cases consistent with state law, which bars prosecutors from trying juveniles as adults without a judge's approval. Another committee created by Gascón makes decisions on whether individual juvenile cases should be transferred to adult court.

Gascón touts his commitment to ""balanced reform"" in a system that historically has disproportionately locked up people of color. And he has counterattacked by accusing Hochman of campaigning on ""Trumpish fearmongering"" and wanting to return to the days of the failed war on drugs and mass incarceration.

""My opponent has a disconnection with the truth,"" Gascón said during a debate.

Hochman defended himself as a lifelong centrist who never supported former President Donald Trump and plans to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris this year.

""I have been pro-choice my whole life, I have been pro-LGBTQ rights my whole life,"" he said.

Hochman advanced out of a field of 11 challengers in one of the most crowded primary fields in L.A. history. He has been endorsed by local police unions, victims' advocacy groups, developer and former mayoral candidate Rick Caruso, and more than 70 current and former elected officials across the county.

Gascón is a former Los Angeles police officer who served as district attorney of San Francisco from 2011 to 2019 and was also chief of police in Mesa, Arizona, and San Francisco. He has been endorsed by a majority of the L.A. County supervisors, local Democratic groups, and labor groups including the county Federation of Labor.",https://abc7.com/post/los-angeles-county-district-attorney-race-voters-decide-between-george-gascn-nathan-hochman/15512475/,ABC7,eng,2024-11-05,15:43:41,
police killing,2024-11-533854488,Jury convicts former Kentucky officer of using excessive force on Breonna Taylor during deadly raid,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A federal jury on Friday convicted a former Kentucky police detective of using excessive force on Breonna Taylor during a botched 2020 drug raid that left her dead.

The 12-member jury returned the late-night verdict after clearing Brett Hankison earlier in the evening on a charge that he used excessive force on Taylor's neighbors.

It was the first conviction of a Louisville police officer who was involved in the deadly raid.

""Breonna Taylor's life mattered,"" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. ""We hope the jury's verdict recognizing this violation of Ms. Taylor's civil and constitutional rights brings some small measure of comfort to her family and loved ones who have suffered so deeply from the tragic events of March 2020.""

Some members of the jury were in tears as the verdict was read around 9:30 p.m. They had earlier indicated to the judge in two separate messages that they were deadlocked on the charge of using excessive force on Taylor, but chose to continue deliberating. The six man, six woman jury deliberated for more than 20 hours over three days.

Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, celebrated the verdict with friends outside the federal courthouse, saying: ""It took a lot of time. It took a lot of patience. It was hard. The jurors took their time to really understand that Breonna deserved justice.""

Hankison fired 10 shots into Taylor's glass door and windows during the raid, but didn't hit anyone. Some shots flew into a next-door neighbor's adjoining apartment.

The death of the 26-year-old Black woman, along with the May 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked racial injustice protests nationwide.

Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., called the verdict ""a long-awaited moment of accountability.""

""While it cannot restore Breonna to her family, it represents a crucial step in the pursuit of justice and a reminder that no one should be above the law,"" King said in a social media post Friday night.

A separate jury deadlocked on federal charges against Hankison last year, and he was acquitted on state charges of wanton endangerment in 2022.

The conviction against Hankison carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. He will be sentenced on March 12 by U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings.

Hankison, 48, argued throughout the trial that he was acting to protect his fellow officers after Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired on them when they broke down Taylor's door with a battering ram.

This jury sent a note on Thursday to the judge asking whether they needed to know if Taylor was alive as Hankison fired his shots.

That was a point of contention during closing arguments, when Hankison's attorney Don Malarcik told the jury that prosecutors must ""prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Taylor was alive"" when Hankison fired.

After the jury sent the question, Jennings urged them to keep deliberating.

Walker shot and wounded one of the officers. Hankison testified that when Walker fired, he moved away, rounded the corner of the apartment unit and fired into Taylor's glass door and a window.

Meanwhile, officers at the door returned Walker's fire, hitting and killing Taylor, who was in a hallway.

Hankison's lawyers argued during closing statements Wednesday that Hankison was acting properly ""in a very tense, very chaotic environment"" that lasted about 12 seconds. They emphasized that Hankison's shots didn't hit anyone.

Hankison was one of four officers charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2022 with violating Taylor's civil rights. Hankison's verdict is the second conviction from those cases. The first was a plea deal from a former officer who was not at the raid and became a cooperating witness in another case.

Malarcik, Hankison's attorney, spoke at length during closing arguments about the role of Taylor's boyfriend, who fired the shot that hit former Sgt. John Mattingly at the door. He said Walker never tried to come to the door or turn the lights on as police were knocking and instead armed himself and hid in the dark.

""Brett Hankison was 12 inches away from being shot by Kenneth Walker,"" Malarcik said.

Prosecutors said Hankison acted recklessly, firing 10 shots into doors and a window where he couldn't see a target.

They said in closing arguments that Hankison ""violated one of the most fundamental rules of deadly force: If they cannot see the person they're shooting at, they cannot pull the trigger.""

Neither of the officers who shot Taylor -- Mattingly and former Detective Myles Cosgrove -- were charged in Taylor's death.

The 12-member jury remained deadlocked on the second charge, which involves Brett Hankison using excessive force on Taylor, who was fatally shot by other officers. The jury could continue to deliberate on that charge Friday night, but they have indicated to the judge in two notes that they are deadlocked on that count.

police killing,8378055748,U.N. Warns Haiti Conflict Has 'Worsened' as Gangs Expand Attack Area,"The United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) said on Tuesday that the situation in the impoverished and violence-torn nation has ""regrettably worsened"" because ambitious gangs are now attacking territory they do not control yet, rather than merely terrorizing people on the turf they already rule.

""The situation in Haiti has not improved. There has been a 22% increase in the number of displaced people, and the political process is facing significant challenges, turning hope into deep concern,"" BINUH director Maria Isabel Salvador told the U.N. Security Council (UNSC).

Salvador said the security environment in Haiti ""remains extremely fragile, with renewed peaks of acute violence."" She highlighted the savage October 3 gang attack on Pont-Sonde in the Artibonite Department, in which 115 civilians were killed by heavily armed gangsters seeking revenge for police killing members of their organization.

Another massacre spotlighted by the BINUH director occurred in the town of Arcahaie, famed as the birthplace of Haiti's flag, during the first two weeks of October. Gang enforcers murdered entire families in Arcahaie and tossed their bodies into mass graves, evidently to extend the authority of warlord Jeff Larose and his Canaan gang over the area.

Salvador said the rapid expansion of gang violence into the suburbs of Port-au-Prince, and then into the surrounding farmlands, is too much for the Haitian National Police (HNP) and the handful of officers sent by Kenya to keep up with. She said gang leaders are ""spreading terror and fear, overwhelming the national security apparatus.""

Several countries have pledged to send over 3,000 troops to Haiti for peacekeeping, but only a few hundred have arrived to date. Gang leaders have scoffed at the Kenyan officers, deriding them as entirely ineffective. Kenyan officers have only been involved in one major operation to date, recapturing the town of Ganthier from a gang called 400 Mawozo in July. The gangsters simply left town when the Kenyan officers arrived, then recaptured the town within days of their departure.

Catherine Russell, advocate for Haiti from the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), said Haiti's gangs are increasingly using sexual violence against women and children to keep the population in line.

Russell noted that up to half of the informants, menial servants, and sex slaves held by the gangs are children, and some of them have been forced into service as child soldiers.

""Gang rape is used as a weapon, and the bodies of women and girls are battlefields,"" agreed Rosy Auguste Ducena of Haiti's Naitonal Human Rights Defense Network.

Ducena complained of ""rampant corruption"" among high-ranking Haitian officials, who are draining the national treasury and funneling some of their loot to gangs, who use the money to purchase weapons.

The U.N. estimates that some 4,200 Haitians have been driven from their homes in the suburbs of Port-au-Prince in just the past week, joining the 700,000 people displaced by the gang war since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July 2021.

On Monday, a gangster coalition called Viv Ansanm began attacking the government-controlled neighborhood of Solino in Port-au-Prince, which has been used as a safe haven for refugees. Haitian President Gary Conille ordered police and soldiers to be redeployed from protecting VIPs to shore up the defenses of Solino. Conille added that he is expecting 150 troops from the Bahamas to reinforce Haitian police within the next few months.",https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2024/10/23/u-n-warns-haiti-conflict-has-worsened-as-gangs-expand-attack-area/,Breitbart,eng,2024-10-24,04:00:53,
police killing,2024-10-524303132,"Accused Season 2, Episode 3 Review: Nick Cannon's Episode Tries to Do Too Much","The following contains major spoilers from Accused Season 2, Episode 3, ""Marcus' Story,"" which debuted Tuesday, Oct. 22 on FOX. It also contains discussion of violence.

Accused Season 2, Episode 3, ""Marcus' Story"" is the first episode of the FOX anthology not to hit its mark -- though not for lack of trying. Rather, its fatal flaw comes from a good place: it's simply trying to do too much and therefore doesn't get everywhere it wants to go. And if a TV show is going to have a less than perfect episode, it's better to have one that aims too high and wants too much than one that doesn't put in enough effort.

""Marcus' Story"" focuses on the involuntary manslaughter trial of Marcus Paul, who's revealed to have been the co-founder of a successful facial recognition software brand. However, on the eve of the company's acquisition by Google, Marcus learns that a previous issue with the software could have contributed to a fatal shooting. The actions he takes to try to make things right put him on the path to his downfall. That's not unlike this episode, which gets the best out of star Nick Cannon but loses itself in its own story.

Accused Season 2, Episode 3 Tackles Too Many Topics

The Script Spreads Itself Too Thin

✕ Remove Ads

The strongest episodes of Accused have one central subject, and then one or perhaps two that are woven subtly into the story along the way. For example, the Season 2 premiere ""Lorraine's Story"" was about a purported psychic, but also tackled the destruction of a marriage and the desperation of a woman to be seen. In contrast, ""Marcus' Story"" has too many issues on the table. The main plotline is that Marcus Paul is on trial for the involuntary manslaughter of his business partner, Pete Vanderkamp. Then it delves into the idea of responsible technology because their company makes facial recognition software -- which is timely because tech is a hot-button topic, with the debate around artificial intelligence. But the episode doesn't stop there.

It also wants to tackle police misconduct (because a mistake in the software allegedly played a part in the Sacramento police killing an innocent man). And it wants to have an extortion angle (as Marcus finds this information out from an employee, who feels she was wronged by Pete). It also wants to talk about race and class, and the implosion of Marcus and Pete's almost two decades-long friendship. There's too many angles to the story, and because of that, Accused doesn't service all of them with the same thoughtfulness it usually does. The storyline would have benefited from being simplified down to be about responsible use of technology versus profit, and the additional responsibility that Marcus feels as a Black man. If Marcus had been facing trial for his company's role in the shooting death of Xavier Skilling, that would've been a less twisty episode, but it would've been equally gripping and allowed for several of the same notes to be hit.

Pete Vanderkamp: Human error killed Xavier Skilling. Not our software.

Furthermore, some of the elements come into the story too late. Marcus' wife Lycia Paul -- played by Grey's Anatomy alum Jerrika Hinton -- is a defense witness, and she tearfully admits that she convinced him to stay silent, because she wanted the more privileged life that selling the company would allow her and their son Marcellus. That's a point worth digging into further, especially because it's not solely greed that fuels her, but there's just not enough time when the show has to give closure to everything in 42 minutes.

Accused Season 2, Episode 2 Review: Taylor Schilling Shines in Self-Destructive Tragedy

Accused Season 2, Episode 2, ""April's Story"" is a career-best outing for Taylor Schilling, as the FOX show turns a road rage thriller into a tragedy.

Nick Cannon's Accused Performance Will Surprise Viewers

Cannon Holds the Episode Together

Nick Cannon's casting in Accused may surprise some viewers, because he's not seen as a dramatic actor. They're more likely to know him from his Nickelodeon days or as the former host of America's Got Talent. The role of Marcus Paul is different from anything he's done before, and he rises to the occasion. What makes the episode work is that Marcus' motivation, all the way through, is to do better -- whether it's for his family or when he realizes something has gone wrong. There's no doubt about his heart. The character requires someone who can be painfully earnest, especially at the end, when Marcus delivers a monologue to the entire courtroom. Without all the groundwork from earlier in the episode, that plea for forgiveness and vow to change would just seem preachy and melodramatic.

✕ Remove Ads

But Cannon pours in all the emotion that the script for ""Marcus' Story"" requires. He has an interesting back-and-forth with Patrick J. Adams, who portrays Marcus' business partner and longtime friend Pete. Adams gets a bit short-changed, because little is established about Pete except for his being a ladies' man and the accusations Marcus levels at him about being self-centered. Viewers have to fill in the blanks about him. Yet it's fun to see Adams play this kind of character after his run as Mike Ross on Suits, because this is the kind of company Mike Ross would have taken down. And the actor's natural vulnerability keeps Pete from being a one-dimensional jerk, also lending credence to his arguments, because the audience wants to believe him. There have been plenty of stories about terrible corporate executives; Accused gives the audience two characters who feel like actual people.

Marcus Paul: Pete just does what he wants to do. And when someone calls you on it, you've always got a convenient little excuse. It's who you are. Who you've always been.

Pete Vanderkamp: And you're just realizing all of this right now?

The same can't be said for almost all of the female characters, though. Hinton does her best as Lycia, but there's nothing about her beyond being the loving and supportive wife. Even her big testimony scene is about her family. Amanda Zhou plays Mary Wax, the employee who blackmails Marcus by threatening to go to the media. In another episode, Accused could've gone into her story (it's mentioned that she pled guilty to her own charges earlier). But she's mostly a character witness for Marcus, tearfully vouching for him. Ironically, the one supporting character who shines is the one with the least screen time.

Accused viewers likely recognized the actor playing Xavier Skilling's widow Lenore Skilling: that's LisaGay Hamilton, best known for her role as Rebecca Washington in The Practice. The first legal drama created by David E. Kelley, The Practice helped launch the careers of several actors and led to the successful spinoff Boston Legal. Once the show ended in 2003, Hamilton's other credits included Men of a Certain Age, The First and winning a Peabody Award for the documentary Beah: A Black Woman Speaks. She doesn't have a lot to do in Accused, but when she's on screen, it's impossible to look away.

One of the most powerful scenes in the episode is when a guilt-ridden Marcus decides to visit the bakery that Lenore ran with Xavier before his death. He strikes up a conversation with her about the business and her family, with her having no clue who he is or what his connection is to that tragic event. Audiences can see Marcus' heart breaking for her -- but they also see Lenore's poise and her dignity as someone carrying on in the wake of the most difficult event she could ever imagine. Of course, there's the scene where she excoriates Marcus from the witness stand too, but the quieter moment is much more poignant. When Marcus turns around after being acquitted and speaks to Lenore directly, the reason that scene works is because of what Cannon and Hamilton have invested into their characters.

""Marcus' Story"" is not a terrible episode of television; even a less than perfect episode of Accused is better than most of what's on TV today. It simply doesn't achieve the level of complex yet organic storytelling of other installments, and some characters aren't as well-developed as a result. But for what it does have, it memorably pulls at viewers' heartstrings.

suspect shot at,2024-10-530250553,Gunman in fatal shooting in upscale Los Angeles neighborhood at large,"A search is underway for a suspect that shot and killed a person in the upscale Los Angeles neighborhood of Mid-Wilshire Tuesday night.

Officers with the Los Angeles Police Department responded to the area West 10 Street and Victoria Avenue, less than a mile from the Getty House where L.A. Mayor Karen Bass resides, at around 4:30 p.m. on reports of an assault with a deadly weapon.

Details are extremely limited and it's unclear how exactly the violence unfolded, but police told KTLA that they believe the two men were involved in some type of altercation when the suspect, described Black male in his 50's, with a gray beard and possibly wearing an orange vest, produced a gun and shot the victim.

Very little is known about the victim, who is only described as Hispanic male, and it's unclear if the man was a resident of the normally quiet neighborhood.

In footage of the ongoing homicide investigation, yellow police tape cordoning off the crime scene can be seen while police canvass the area for evidence.

A white canopy, used to cover the victim while the scene remains active, was also visible on the street.

Anyone with information about the deadly shooting is urged to call detectives at the Los Angeles Police Department's Wilshire Community Police Station at 213-847-3994.
